CHAPTER V.
========
PARTS COMPOSING THE UNDER-CARRIAGE.—FRAMING THEM TOGETHER.—WROUGHT-IRON PERCHES.—BRAKES.
========
We have now to consider the construction of the lower framework, or carriage.
========
The following is a list of the chief parts of a coach, as generally known:—
========
Wheels.
========
Axles.
========
Springs.
========
Beds, or cross framing timbers, which are technically termed the fore axle bed, the hind axle bed, fore spring bed or transom, hind spring bed, and horn bar.
========
Perch, or central longitudinal timber connecting the axletrees.
========
Wings, which are spreading sides, hooped to the perch and framed to the hind beds.
========
Nunters, or small framing pieces, which help to bind the hind beds together.
========
Hooping-piece. A piece of timber scarped and hooped to the fore end of the perch to secure it to the
========
Wheel plate, which is the circular iron beneath which the fore carriage turns.
========
The fore carriage consists of the fore axle beds, into which are framed the
========
[49]
========
Futchells (French, fourchil, a fork), which are the longitudinal timbers supporting the
========
Splinter-bar and the
========
Pole, to which the horses are attached.
========
The hinder ends of the futchells support the
========
Sway-bar—a circular piece of timber working beneath the wheel-plate.
========
A circular piece of timber of smaller size, supported on the fore part of the futchells for a similar purpose, is called the
========
Felloe-piece (often made of iron).
========
On the splinter-bar are fixed the
========
Roller bolts, for fastening the traces.
========
On the pole is fixed the
========
Pole hook, to secure the harness.
========
The perch and beds are strengthened with iron plates, where necessary, and the other ironwork consists of
========
Splinter-bar stays, to resist the action of the draught. Formerly these were affixed to the ends of the axles and called “wheel-irons.”
========
Tread-steps, for the coachman to mount by.
========
Footman’s step.
========
Spring-stays.
========
On the beds are placed
========
Blocks, to support the
========
C springs; to which are attached
========
Jacks, or small windlasses, and
========
Leathern suspension braces.
========
These parts fitted together would form what is generally known as a coach, or a vehicle, the body of which is large, and suspended by leathern braces from the ends of C springs. They enter into the formation of all vehicles more or less, but for the other kinds some part or parts are omitted, as in a brougham hung on elliptic springs, the C springs, perch, leather braces, &c., would be omitted, and, of course, elliptic springs and a pump-handle would be added. All the woodwork[50] is lightened as much as possible by the introduction of beading, carving, chamfering, &c.
========
In starting the carriage part the workman first takes the perch and planes a flat side to it, and then works it taper from front to back. The top and bottom curves are then worked up, or at least some portion of them, and then the front and hind spring beds are framed on. A pair of spreading wings are then fitted to the sides of the perch; these are simply circular iron stays, swelled and moulded to take off their plainness. A pair is fitted at each end of the perch. The hind axletree bed is then scarfed upon the top of the perch and wings, and is connected with the hind spring bed by two small framing pieces called nunters. At the front end of the perch a cross bed called a horn-bar is scarfed on the perch, at the same distance from the fore spring bed as the hind axle bed is from the hind spring bed, viz. the length of the bearing of the spring, or about 15 inches. The horn-bar is connected with the fore spring bed by the two spring blocks, which are either framed into them or scarfed down on them, and also by the hooping-piece, which is scarfed on the top of the perch. The perch is then planed up to the curve it is to have when finished, and it is then taken to the smith, who fits and rivets on the side plates, which have ears at the ends for the purpose of bolting them to the beds. The carver then does his work by beading the perch and beds, having due regard to the finish of the parts, rounds and curves all the ends. On the under side of the perch is riveted an iron plate, and on this plate is an iron hook for hanging the drag shoe and chain (if such be used). The hind framing is now put together, all connections being by means of mortises and tenons secured by screw-bolts. The wings used to be, and sometimes still are, of wood, in which case they are hooped to the perch by iron hoops, and are rebated to receive the perch plates. The hooping-piece is then hooped in a similar way to the fore end of the perch, and the[51] transom firmly bolted. The carriage is then turned bottom upwards, and the smith fits to the fore part the wheel plate or turning iron, across which runs a broad plate the width and length of the fore spring bed. A similar plate runs across the hind spring bed. The hind axle is then fitted to the wings and perch, and let into its bed at the ends, where screw clips secure it, the bolts passing through the perch.
========
The carriage is then turned up into its old position; the wheel-plate is cased on the top with carved wood, and a plate is riveted to the side of the horn-bar. The springs are now fitted to their blocks and bolted firmly down. Iron stays are bolted to the springs beneath the beds to render them still firmer. The footman’s step, and the steps for the coachman to mount to his box by, and other ironwork that may be required in the shape of stays, &c., are then fixed in their place.
========
The under portion of the fore carriage is framed to the fore axletree bed, which is a very stout piece of timber. Through this are framed the two futchells which receive the pole. The upper part of the axletree bed is covered with a strong plate to match the wheel-plate. A circular piece of timber, called a sway-bar, is bolted behind the axletree bed, and this is also plated beneath for security. In front is a smaller piece of the same kind, and they both serve for the circumference of the wheel to rest on. The splinter-bar is bolted on to the fore end of the futchells and secured by branching stays, one at either end connecting it with the axletree bed. As an additional security, iron stays are fitted to the bottoms of the futchells passing over the axle, which, in addition to bolts, is secured by screw clips at the ends, the same as the hind one.
========
The carriage above described is one suspended only on C springs. Sometimes elliptic springs are used in conjunction with C springs, and the former are then termed under-springs. In the latter case, of the double combination of[52] springs, the constructional timbers may be of a less size or scantling, owing to some of the strain and concussion being removed. In this case the axles are clipped to the under-springs; but the general mode of construction is the same.
========
In first-class work a wrought-iron perch is used instead of the before described wooden one. This generally follows the contour of the underside of the body, and is called a swan neck. It enables the perch to be constructed of a much lighter appearance, and being really light, and to a certain extent elastic, all the beds and iron stays may be proportionately reduced in weight. The wheels and axles also, having less to carry, may also be made lighter. The system was introduced by Messrs. Hooper about 1846, and at first was only applied to broughams and sociables, but it has gradually been applied to the largest carriages, especially barouches and landaus. These perches are supported on horizontal under-springs, and are not now made so light as at first, for it is found that unless the hind wheels follow steadily, not only is the carriage heavier behind the horse, but the perch itself is frequently bent against very small obstructions; a stronger and stiffer perch is therefore now used, and it is found easier both to the horse and to the passengers.
========
When the body is suspended from C springs by leather braces, great care should be used in the selection of the material for these latter, and for this purpose the best and strongest leather is required.
========
The use of brake retarders to the hind wheels has now for some years superseded the old-fashioned drag shoes. It is evident that the action on two wheels must be better than on one only. The brake can be applied or removed without stopping the carriage, which is necessary if a drag shoe be used. This is rather an important consideration in undulating country, for it would be a great inconvenience to have to get down and put on the drag shoe when descending a[53] hill, and when at the bottom to stop and get down again to remove it, in order to proceed along level ground or up the next hill, and so keep on like this all day. The lever brake was the original form, as still seen on drags, &c., but in many parts it is superseded by the foot or treadle brake, more especially in Scotland. This kind of brake is also the one used by the London Omnibus Company. The blocks which press upon the wheels have been made of various substances—cast iron, wrought iron, brass, wood, india-rubber, and leather. The wood is the best for the hold on the iron tyre and absence of noise and smell, but it wears out fast. India-rubber, especially for light carriages, seems to be the most satisfactory.
========
We have given, generally, the operation of framing together the under or carriage parts of the vehicle. But as some very important considerations regulate the shape, construction, and formation of most of these parts, they must be discussed separately. For this purpose they will be considered under the following headings:—
========
Wheels.
========
Axles.
========
Springs.
========
Wheel-plates and fore-carriages.
========
Ironwork generally.
