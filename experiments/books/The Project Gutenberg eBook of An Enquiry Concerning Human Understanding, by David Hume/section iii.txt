========
OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.
========
18. It is evident that there is a principle of     connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in their     appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain     degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse this is so     observable that any particular thought, which breaks in upon the regular tract or     chain of ideas, is immediately remarked and rejected. And even in our wildest and     most wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that     the imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a     connexion upheld among the different ideas, which succeeded each other. Were the     loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed, there would immediately be     observed something which connected it in all its transitions. Or where this is     wanting, the person who broke the thread of discourse might still inform you, that     there had secretly revolved in his mind a succession of thought, which had gradually     led him from the subject of conversation. Among different languages, even where we     cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the words,     expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other: a     certain proof that the simple ideas, comprehended in the compound ones, were bound     together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all     mankind.
========
19. Though it be too obvious to escape observation,     that different ideas are connected together; I do not find that any philosopher has     attempted to enumerate or class all the principles of association; a subject,     however, that seems worthy of curiosity. To me, there appear to be only three     principles of connexion among ideas, namely, Resemblance, Contiguity in     time or place, and Cause or Effect.

3: and if we think of a wound, we can scarcely     forbear reflecting on the pain which follows it

4. But that this     enumeration is complete, and that there are no other principles of association except     these, may be difficult to prove to the satisfaction of the reader, or even to a     man's own satisfaction. All we can do, in such cases, is to run over several     instances, and examine carefully the principle which binds the different thoughts to     each other, never stopping till we render the principle as general as possible
========
5. The     more instances we examine, and the more care we employ, the more assurance shall we     acquire, that the enumeration, which we form from the whole, is complete and     entire.
