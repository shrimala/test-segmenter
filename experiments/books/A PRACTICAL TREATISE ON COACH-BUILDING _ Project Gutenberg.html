</div>


<p class="noindent">It is singular that such an important industry as
coach-building should have received such slight attention
from writers either at home or abroad; yet such is
the case, the last book dealing in any way exhaustively
with the trade having been published some fifty years
ago. The manufacturers themselves have doubtless
very copious notes, which, if printed, would make several
large volumes; but they do not publish the result of
their experience to the world, and consequently the
general public, and more particularly apprentices and
others whose occupations or amusements may be in
any way connected with the trade, have no means of
gaining an insight into this branch of industrial art.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this book will supply, to some extent
at least, this deficiency. Its object is general utility
rather than technical instructions on minor details.
The principles on which carriages ought to be constructed,
rather than the arbitrary proportions of parts,
are what the author has sought to make clear.</p>

<p>From an antiquarian point of view the history of
carriages is very interesting. In the first chapter the
gradual development of vehicles and their parts from
the first rude forms of raft and sledge, down to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
shapes with which we are now familiar, has been carefully
dealt with, and all matters of interest in connection
therewith have been added.</p>

<p>In dealing with the practical part of the business, the
preliminary operations of the carriage designer and
draughtsman are first considered, and directions given
how to make the drawing of a proposed vehicle; from
whence the reader is taken into the workshop, where he
is introduced to the points which usually have to be
considered before commencing the construction of a
vehicle, and instructions given as to the preparation of
the full-sized working draughts or drawings. The
component parts of body and carriage are then particularised,
and notes added to assist in their being
properly understood. A glance is given at the various
materials used, and then the most important parts of
the vehicle are dealt with separately, as wheels, axles,
springs, &amp;c., both the theory and manufacture of each
part being given, in order to make clear the work it
has to perform in operation, and the means of obviating
difficulties.</p>

<p>In the chapter devoted to the painting department a
slight sketch has been given of the theory of colour,
in order that the unscientific reader may understand
the harmonies and contrasts of colour, which are so
important to the successful conduct of this branch.
The materials and implements that the painter uses are
described, and the vehicle followed through the successive
stages of priming, painting, colouring, and
varnishing. In addition to this a chapter is given on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>
“Ornamental Painting” <i>i.e.</i> painting monograms,
crests, and coats of arms on the carriage panels.</p>

<p>In the chapter “General Observations on the Trade”
several interesting facts and statistics have been dealt
with; such as the present position of carriage artisans;
application of machinery; the coach trade in America
and in India; also the theory of lengthening or shortening
the carriage parts.</p>

<p>A chapter on “Invention” has been added, which it
is trusted may prove of value. As a concluding
chapter, some hints on the proper treatment of carriages
by their private owners have been given, which will no
doubt be useful to the coach-builder.</p>

<p>What few authorities there are on the subject have
been carefully consulted by the author, with a view to
making the book as accurate and reliable as possible.</p>

<p>If any member of the trade desires to make suggestions
as to improvement in any of the processes
given, his communication, addressed to the author
(care of the publishers), will be carefully considered
in connection with subsequent editions of the work.</p>

<span class="fs80">GENERAL HISTORY.</span>
</h2>

<p class="noindent">The origin of the word coach has not yet been
accurately determined. Menage says it is taken from the Latin <i lang="la">vehiculum</i>, which most people will take the liberty
of doubting; Wachten, from the German <i lang="de">kutten</i>,
to cover; Lye, from the Belgic <i>koetsen</i>, to lie along, or,
as it really means, a couch or chair; it has also been tried to
prove that the word is of Hungarian origin, and that it took its
name from <i lang="hu">Kotsee</i>, the old name of the province
of Wiesellung, where various kinds of carriages were made; and
in Beckmann’s “History of Inventions” it is mentioned that “when
the Archbishop received certain intelligence that the Turks had
entered Hungary, not contented with informing the king by letter,
he speedily got into one of those light carriages of the place
they call <i lang="hu">kotcze</i>, and hastened to his majesty.”
This, in addition to the fact that some years previously the
King of Hungary presented to the Queen of Bohemia a vehicle that
excited great wonder and admiration, by reason of its trembling
(<i lang="hu">branlant</i>), showing clearly that it must have
been suspended, is strongly in favour of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Hungarian coachmakers; but we must leave it
to the philologists to determine the exact truth, for what with the
<i lang="fr">caroche</i> of France, the <i lang="it">caroce</i> of
Italy, the <i lang="es">carri-coche</i> of Spain, and our own coach,
the head gets somewhat bewildered, and is fain to take refuge in
the simple <i lang="la">carruca</i> of ancient Rome, from which
these appellations most probably had their rise. In any case the
honour must be a divided one, as the <i>caretta</i>, <i>chare</i>,
car, <i>charat</i>, &amp;c., must have been the earliest forms of
the derivation, as such were the names given to the first vehicles;
later, we have the Hungarian <i lang="hu">kotcze</i>, the German <i lang="de">kutsche</i>, &amp;c., and adding both form and name to what
had gone before, produced a mixed vehicle with a mixed appellation.
Dr. Johnson defines coach as a “little carriage.” The <em>large</em>
carriage that he had in his mind’s eye at the time must have been a
marvellous vehicle.</p>

<p>The progress of the art of coach-making, like the progress
of most inventions and discoveries, has been rather slow, we
may say remarkably slow; sometimes it made a sudden
start, but a reaction in the other direction generally settled
it before much advance had been made; but seeing that the
early portions of the Old Testament contain references to
wheel carriages, it does seem rather strange that perfection
should take so long to arrive at. This may be partly
accounted for by the fact that the nations of the earth were
always at war with one another, and consequently had no
time to foster inventive power. And this has unfortunately
been the case until comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>The first land carriages were doubtless very primitive
contrivances. Though the “chariot” and the “waggon”
are mentioned in Genesis, no description is given of their
construction. Joseph rode in the second chariot of Pharaoh
as a mark of great honour and dignity. “Waggons” were
dispatched from the court of Egypt to convey thither the
wives and little ones of the family of Jacob. From this, as
well as the fact of the brethren of Joseph bearing their corn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
away on asses, we may infer that wheel carriages, even of
the most simple construction, were not in general use at this
time. It is very probable that the common vehicle of the
period was an embryo sledge, drawn by man or beast along
the ground.</p>

<p>The Bible and the hieroglyphics on the various ruins of
ancient Egypt furnish us with the earliest authentic records.
In the case of Egypt this is particularly valuable to us,
because of the great degree of culture arrived at in the
civilised arts. In fact it is the chief country of which we
have any record of the progress of these arts, and though
not actually established, it is extremely probable that to the
Egyptians we owe the invention, or at least the introduction
of the wheel. These people were early engaged in the
erection of large buildings and monuments, of which the
pyramids and sphinxes are such striking examples; and in
order to convey the enormous blocks of stone and granite to
their ultimate destination, the roller would be the first thing
to suggest itself as a means of facilitating transit. The next
step would be the formation of a truck, to which these rollers
could be attached, and on which could be placed the materials
to be moved. Progression with a contrivance of this kind
would necessarily be rather slow, but it would soon become
apparent that if a larger roller were used the motion could
be accelerated. The next improvement would be an endeavour
to lighten the rollers by sawing them into thick
slices, and connecting them by a horizontal roller of smaller
dimensions, giving a rude representation of a wheel and
axle. The agricultural carts used by the peasantry of Chili,
in South America, were made in this fashion until very
recently. The further lightening of these cars would follow
almost as a matter of course, by cutting the slices of the
trunk to form the wheel, thinner, and further by cutting
away portions of this slice, forming spokes. The wheel
having arrived at this stage of perfection, the axle would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
call for a little attention. Up till the present, they would be
fixed firmly to the wheels and revolve with them. This
arrangement would cause great inconvenience in turning, for
one wheel would revolve more rapidly than the other, by
reason of the circle described by one wheel in turning round
being greater than that of the other, and the vehicle would
be liable to overturn. The next step was to arrange that
the wheels could revolve independently of the axle. This
being done, we have the wheel, in its principles, the same
as at present.</p>

</figure>

<p>The paintings and sculptures upon the walls of the temples and
tombs of Egypt show that wheeled carriages were in use in that
country at an early period (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig01_2" class="pginternal">Figs. 1 and 2</a>). In the Bible they
are usually translated “chariot.” They are of great interest to
us, as they formed the chief means of conveying man for 2,000
years before Christ, and were more or less the type of all the
other vehicles of the ancient world. We find certain words used
in describing them, both by Homer, who lived 1,000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and by Moses, who lived at least 500
years earlier; and these words are the technical terms in use at the
present day, such as axles, wheels, naves, tyres, spokes, &amp;c.
It is reasonable to infer from this, that the art to which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> these terms apply must have
existed prior to the writers’ description; so that any doubt as to
the correctness of the Egyptian sculptures must be dispelled by the
references of the above authors. In the fifth book of the Iliad “The
awful Juno led out the golden-bitted horses, whilst Hebe fitted the
whirling wheels on the iron axle of the swift chariot. The wheels
had each eight brazen spokes, the felloes were of gold, secured with
brazen tyres all round, admirable to the sight. The seat was of gold
hung by silver cords, the beam or pole was of silver, at the end of
which were hung the golden yoke and the golden reins.”</p>

 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 3.—Roman Chariot.</figcaption>

<p>The car was greatly used by the Romans, being adopted
from the one used by the Etrurians (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig03" class="pginternal">Fig. 3</a>), a neighbouring
country on the Italian
peninsula. These latter
people were traditionally
the first to place
a hood or awning over
the open two-wheeled
car, and they showed
great taste in decorating
their vehicles in
the manner familiar to
us by the remains of their pottery. A very fine copy of
one of the Roman cars is in the museum at South Kensington,
cast from the original in the Vatican.</p>

<p>Herodotus (450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) mentions that
the Scythians used a vehicle which consisted of a rough platform upon
wheels, on which was placed a covering like a beehive, composed of
basket work and covered with skins. When they pitched anywhere these
huts were taken off, and served them as dwellings in lieu of tents.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig04" class="pginternal">Fig. 4</a> shows one of their chariots.</p>

<p>The war chariots used by the Persians were much larger
than those used by contemporary nations. The idea seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
to have been to form a sort of turret on the car to protect
the warriors in action. These vehicles were provided with
curved blades, like scythes, which projected from the axletrees,
for the purpose of maiming the enemy as they drove
through them.</p>

 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 4.—Scythian Chariot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the period of the invasion of this country by the
Romans, a car or
chariot seems to have
been in use which
they had not met
with before. It was
larger than the Roman
car, and possessed
a seat, from
which feature it was
called <i lang="la">essedum</i>. It
was doubtless an improved vehicle of its kind, for Cicero,
writing to a friend in Britain, says “that there appeared
little worth bringing away from Britain except the chariots,
of which he wished his friend to bring him one as a pattern.”</p>

<p>Sir William Gell, in his work on Pompeii, which was destroyed
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 79, mentions that three wheels
had been dug out of the ruins in his day, very much like our modern
wheels—a little dished, and 4 feet 3 inches high, with ten spokes
rather thicker at each end than in the middle. He also gives an
illustration of a cart used for the conveyance of wine in a large
skin or leather bag; it is a four-wheeled cart, with an arch in the
centre for the front wheel to turn under. The pole appears to end in
a fork, and to be attached to the axle bed.</p>

<p>On the decline of the Roman power, many of the arts of
civilisation which they had been instrumental in forwarding
fell into disuse. The skilled artisans died and left no successors,
there being no demand for them. This will account
for no mention being made of carriages or chariots for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
centuries. Of course there were various primitive contrivances
in use to which the name of cart was given, but
the great and wealthy moved about the cities or travelled
on horseback, or if they were incapable of this, they used
litters carried by men or horses. The great bar to the
general adoption of wheeled carriages was undoubtedly the
very bad state of the roads.</p>

<p>An evident improvement in construction was made by the
Saxons. In the Cotton Library there is a valuable illuminated
manuscript, supposed to be the work of Elfricus,
Abbot of Malmesbury. The subject is a commentary on the
Books of Genesis and Exodus, with accompanying illustrations.
In one of these is represented the first approach to
a slung carriage; and it may be interesting to the lovers of
historical coincidence that it is given in an illustration of
the meeting of Joseph and Jacob, and in that part of the
Bible which first makes mention of vehicular conveyance.
The chariot in which Joseph is seated is a kind of hammock
(most probably made of leather, which was much used by
the Anglo-Saxons), suspended by iron hooks from a framework
of wood. It moves upon four wheels, the construction
of which is not clear, owing to the decorative license
taken with them by the artist. The father of Joseph is
placed in a cart, which we doubt not, from its extreme
simplicity, is a faithful type of those of the time. This
proves the illuminator to have been true to his subject and
the custom of the period in which he lived, as the chariot
was monopolised by the great men, while the people rode in
carts.</p>

<p>With the Normans came the horse litter, a native originally
of Bithynia, and from thence introduced into Rome, where it is
still used by the Pope on state occasions, and also among the
mountain passes of Sicily, as well as in Spain and Portugal.
Malmesbury records that the dead body of Rufus was placed upon a
<i lang="la">rheda caballaria</i>, a kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> horse litter. King John, in his last illness,
was conveyed from the Abbey of Swinstead <i lang="la">in lectica
equestre</i>. These were for several succeeding reigns the only
carriages in use for persons of distinction. Froissart writes of
Isabel, the second wife of Richard II., as <span lang="fr">“La june
Royne d’Angleterre en une litieré moult riche qui etoit ordonèe
pour elle.”</span> These litters were seldom used except on state
occasions. When Margaret, daughter of Henry II., went into Scotland,
she is described as journeying on a “faire palfrey,” but after her
was conveyed by two footmen “one very riche litere, borne by two
faire coursers vary nobly drest; in which litere the sayd queene
was borne in the intryng of the good towns or otherwise to her good
playsher.”</p>

<p>Carriages proper were first introduced on the continent.
Italy, France, Spain, and Germany contend with each other
for the honour of the first introduction. The earliest
record we have is on the authority of Beckmann, who says
that, when at the close of the thirteenth century Charles
of Anjou entered Naples, his queen rode in a <i lang="it">caretta</i>, the
outside and inside of which were covered with sky-blue velvet
interspersed with golden lilies.</p>

<p>The English were not long before they adopted this new
innovation. In an early English poem called the “Squyr
of Low Degree,” supposed to be before the time of
Chaucer, the father of the Princess of Hungary thus makes
promise:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
 <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse indent0">“To-morrow ye shall on hunting fare,</div>
 <div class="verse indent1">And ride my daughter in a <i>chare</i>.</div>
 <div class="verse indent1">It shall be covered with velvet red,</div>
 <div class="verse indent1">And cloths of fine gold all about your head,</div>
 <div class="verse indent1">With damask white and azure blue,</div>
 <div class="verse indent1">Well diapered with lilies new:</div>
 <div class="verse indent1">Your pomelles shall be ended with gold,</div>
 <div class="verse indent1">Your chains enamelled many a fold.”</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The pomelles were doubtless the handles to the rods
affixed towards the roof of the “chariette,” and were for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
purpose of holding by when deep ruts or obstacles in the
roads caused an unusual jerk in the vehicle.</p>

<p>On the continent, there seems to have been a great deal
of opposition to the use of carriages. In 1294, Philip,
King of France, issued an ordinance prohibiting the citizens’
wives the use of cars or chars; and later on, Pope
Pius IV. exhorted his cardinals and bishops not to ride in
coaches, according to the fashion of the time, but to leave
such things to women; and it really was thought <i lang="la">infra dig.</i>
for a man to travel other than on horseback. Even his
Holiness the Pope rode upon a grey horse; though to
indemnify him for the exertion, his horse was led, and his
stirrup held by kings and emperors.</p>

<p>These exhortations had about the same effect as James I.’s
“Counterblast to Tobacco;” they created an increased
demand, and the people showed their sense in preferring the
ease that does no injury to the self-denial that does no good,
in spite of the opposition of their superiors.</p>

<p>The first coach made in England was for the Earl of
Rutland, in 1555, and Walter Rippon was the builder. He
afterwards made one for Queen Mary. Stow’s “Summerie
of the English Chronicle” is the authority upon which this
statement is made.</p>

<p>In a postscript to the life of Thomas Parr, written by Taylor,
the Water Poet (and a mortal enemy to land carriages), we
find the following note: “He (Parr) was eighty-one years
old before there was any coach in England (Parr was born
in Edward IV.’s reign in 1483); for the first ever seen here
was brought out of the Netherlands by one William Boonen,
a Dutchman, who gave a coach to Queen Elizabeth, for she
had been seven years a queen before she had any coach;
since when they have increased with a mischief, and ruined
all the best housekeeping, to the undoing of the watermen,
by the multitudes of Hackney coaches. But they never
swarmed so much to pester the streets as they do now till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the year 1605; and then was the gunpowder treason hatched,
and at that time did the coaches breed and multiply.” Taylor
is to be thanked, not only for his information, but for his
capital though unconscious burlesque upon those fancied
philosophers who talk of cause and effect, where events,
because they happen in sequence, are made to depend one on
the other, when the fact of their being two things apart
makes them independent existences.</p>

<p>We have not space to dwell upon these old specimens at
length. Queen Elizabeth’s coach is called by an old author
“a moving temple.” It had doors all round, so that when
the people desired, and the virgin queen was agreeable, they
might feast their eyes on the beauty of its trimming or
linings.</p>

<p>The following entry in Sir William Dugdale’s diary may
be interesting: “1681. Payd to Mr. Meares, a coachmaker
in St. Martin’s Lane, for a little chariot w<sup>ch</sup> I then
sent into the country, £23 13s. 0d., and for a cover of
canvas £01 00s. 00d.: also for harness for two horses
£04 00s. 00d.”</p>

<p>The opposition on the part of the watermen to the introduction
of coaches assumed rather serious proportions, more
especially as the populace sided with them; to such a height
did the antagonism run that a movement was made to introduce
a Bill into Parliament to prevent the increase of coaches;
the apology for its introduction being, that in war time it
would be a matter of great difficulty to mount the troops if
so many horses were monopolised for these coaches. Luckily,
however, it came to nothing, and the antipathy gradually
died out.</p>

<p>Coaches and vehicles of all descriptions now became
general, and in 1635 a patent was granted to Sir Saunders
Duncombe for the introduction of sedans; their purpose
being “to interfere with the too frequent use of coaches, to
the hindrance of the carts and carriages employed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
necessary provision of the city and suburbs.” A rivalry now
sprung up between coach and sedan, and gave rise to a
humorous tract, in which they hold a colloquy as to which
should take precedence, a brewer’s cart being appointed
umpire.</p>

<p>The coaches at this period were fearfully and wonderfully
made. There are several examples of them scattered about
in the various museums. The people who used them at this
time had no great ideas of them, for so formidable an affair
was the undertaking of a journey reckoned, that even from
Birmingham to London a departure was the signal for
making a will, followed by a solemn farewell of wife, children,
and household!</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century improvements
began to take place. In Wood’s diary mention is made of
a machine called the “Flying Coach,” which performed the
journey between Oxford and London in thirteen hours! This
was express rate for that age, especially as there was some
talk of making a law to limit the ground covered by a coach
to thirty miles a day in summer, and twenty-five miles a day
in winter. Oh, those good old times! The outcry lessened,
and the imperfect vehicles and bad roads were left to passengers
unmolested. What the latter were may be imagined
from the fact that, when Charles III. of Spain visited England,
and Prince George of Denmark went out to meet him, both
princes were so impeded by the badness of the roads that
their carriages were obliged to be borne on the shoulders of
the peasantry, and they were six hours in performing the
last nine miles of their journey.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century improvements were made in the
construction of coaches, but they were still heavy lumbering
contrivances, so that little or no progress was made in the
rate at which they travelled. Even so late as 1760 a journey
from Edinburgh to London occupied eighteen days, a part
of the roads being only accessible by pack horses. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
a very good specimen of the vehicle of the early part of the
eighteenth century in the South Kensington Museum, belonging
to the Earl of Darnley’s family, and is well worthy of study
as being one of the lightest examples known of this period.</p>

<p>In the Museum of South Kensington is also an excellent
example of the fully developed coach of 1790. It is a very
massive-looking affair, and belonged to the Lord Chancellor
of Ireland; it looks very much like a faded edition of the
City state coach now, though when new it doubtless had a
very good appearance. It consists of a very large body,
suspended from upright or whip springs by means of leather
braces; the standing pillars slope outwards, making the sides
longer at the roof than at the elbow line. The wheels are of
good height, and the carriage part is very massively constructed,
the upper part being finished off with scroll ironwork,
and on this in the front the coachman’s hammercloth
is raised. The panels are painted with landscapes, &amp;c., by
Hamilton, R.A., and no doubt altogether it cost a deal of
money.</p>

<p>Vehicles now began to assume that variety of shape and
form of which we have in our own time so many specimens.
There were Landaus, introduced from a town of that name in
Germany; these were, like the coaches, only made to open in
the centre of the roof just as they do now, but instead of the
covering falling into a horizontal line it only fell back to an
angle of 45 degrees, and this pattern was maintained for a
number of years. Landaulets were chariots made to open.
Generally speaking, the difference between a coach and a
chariot was that the former had two seats for the accommodation
of passengers, and the latter but one, and in appearance
was like a coach cut in half. Then came phaetons,
barouches, sociables, curricles, gigs, and whiskies, which, in
their general form and attributes, were similar to the vehicles
of the present day which bear these names. In those days
fast driving was all the “go,” and young men vied with each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
other in driving the loftiest and most dangerous gigs and
phaetons. Contemporary literature teemed with romantic
tales of spills and hairbreadth ’scapes from these vehicles, and
yet dilated on the fearful pleasure there was in driving them.</p>

<p>The larger wheeled vehicles were hung upon framed carriages,
with whip springs behind and elbow springs in front,
like the gentlemen’s cabriolets of the present day. When
drawn by two horses they were called curricles, or by one
horse, chaises. There was a little variation in the shape of
the body, viz. the full curricle pattern and the half curricle,
with or without a boot, similar to a Tilbury or a gig body.
The wheels were 4 feet 3 inches to 5 feet in height. Lancewood
was then used for shafts.</p>

<p>It is at the beginning of the nineteenth century that real
progress is to be found in coaches and other carriages. In
1804, Mr. Obadiah Elliott, a coachmaker of Lambeth,
patented a plan for hanging vehicles upon elliptic springs,
thus doing away with the heavy perch, as the longitudinal
timber or iron connecting the hind-carriage with the fore
carriage is called. Perches are still used, but are chiefly
confined to coaches proper, or those hung upon C springs.
Elliott also considerably lightened the carriage part of the
vehicles he turned out. This was the first step to a grand
revolution in the manufacture of carriages, which was to
affect every variety of vehicle, great or small. Elliott’s
enterprise was rewarded by the gold medal of the Society of
Arts, and by his business becoming a very prosperous one,
for the public were not slow in discovering the advantages
arising from great lightness in vehicles.</p>

<p>A print, published in 1816, shows a landaulet hung on
elliptic springs, four in number, with a square boot framed
to the body, and the driving seat supported on ironwork
high above the boot. Behind there is a footboard supported
on the pump-handles. The distance between the axletrees
is very short, only 6 feet 6 inches from centre to centre.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
The body is rather small, and the wheels are 3 feet 8 inches
and 4 feet 8 inches high respectively, and the bottom of the
body is 3 feet 6 inches above the ground. The span or
opening of the springs is 10 inches.</p>

<p>In 1814 there were 23,400 four-wheeled vehicles paying
duty to Government, 27,300 two-wheeled, and 18,500 tax-carts
in Great Britain, showing a total of 69,200 vehicles.
The later returns will show how much a reduction in the
duties and the use of elliptic springs have promoted the
increase of vehicles of all kinds.</p>

<p>A vehicle much in fashion at this period was the curricle,
which had been in use for some time in Italy, where it was
suspended from leather braces. Springs were added by the
French, and, on its being introduced here, the English
altered the shape, giving the back a graceful ogee curve,
improved the hood, and added a spring bar across the
horses’ backs. It was a vehicle of easy draught, and could
be driven at great speed. Unfortunately it was rather
dangerous if the horse shied or stumbled, and this tended to
reduce the demand for it, and it was gradually superseded
by the cabriolet, though Charles Dickens used one as soon
as he could afford it, and Count D’Orsay had one made as
late as 1836.</p>

<p>The vehicle called the briska, or britchka, was introduced
about 1818 from Austria. It was hung both upon C springs
and elliptic springs, and was made in various sizes for different
requirements. It was nearly straight along the
bottom. The hind panel was ogee shaped, and the front
terminated in a square boot. There was a rumble behind,
and the back seat was fitted with a hood which could be
raised or lowered at pleasure, and the knees were covered
by a folding knee flap. This was an inconvenient vehicle
for our climate, as only half the number could be sheltered
in wet weather that could be accommodated in dry. It was
very fashionable for a time, but died out about 1840.</p>

<p>The “Stanhope” takes its name from being first built to
the order and under the superintendence of the Hon.
Fitzroy Stanhope, by Tilbury, the builder of the vehicle bearing
that name. It was shaped like the old ribbed gig, but
was hung upon four springs, two of which were bolted
between the shaft and axle, and the other two crossways,
parallel to the axle at either end of the body, and shackled
to the side springs. Stanhopes are an easy kind of vehicle,
and do not rock so much as other gigs behind a rough-trotting
horse. At the same time they are rather heavy, owing
to the large amount of iron plating used to strengthen the
shafts, &amp;c.</p>

 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 6.—Tilbury.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The “Tilbury” was very much like the Stanhope, but
had no boot, and like it was heavily plated with iron. It
was hung by two elbow springs in front, with leather braces
to the shafts or front cross bar, and behind by two elbow
springs passing from beneath the seat to a cross spring
raised to the level of the back rail of the body by three
straight irons from the hind part of the cross bar. Later,
two more springs were added between the axletree and the
shafts, by scroll irons. The Tilbury was a very good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and durable vehicle, but its weight took away the public
favour, and it went out of fashion about 1850. It was,
however, adopted with great success by Italy and other continental
countries, where the roads are bad, and solidity of
construction is the first consideration.</p>

<p>Dog-carts and Tandem-carts are too well known to need
description. The former were so called from their being
used for the conveyance of sporting dogs, such as greyhounds
or pointers, and the slats or louvre arrangement of
the sides was for the purpose of admitting air to the animals;
though scarcely ever used for this purpose now, the original
plan has been pretty closely adhered to, except that the boot
is considerably reduced and made to harmonise more with
the other parts.</p>

<p>Some of the greatest improvements in the shape and style
of various vehicles were effected by a celebrated maker
named Samuel Hobson, who remodelled and improved pretty
nearly every vehicle which came under his hands. He particularly
directed his attention to the true proportion of
parts, and artistic form of carriages. He lowered the
bodies, and lengthened the under or “carriage” part. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
curves and sweeps also received due attention. In fact, he
carefully studied those “trifles” (as Michael Angelo’s friend
would have termed them) on which depended the success of
the production as a work of art. Imitation being the
sincerest form of flattery, the other coachmakers soon
showed their sense by copying his best ideas, though, to
give these other coachmakers their due, they greatly
assisted Mr. Hobson with suggestions for improvements,
and as a reward availed themselves of his superior talent
for working on these ideas.</p>

<p>As our interior trade and manufactures increased, the
custom arose of sending commercial travellers throughout
England to call attention to the various goods, and it was
found very convenient to send these travellers in light
vehicles which could convey samples of the various articles.
This led to a very great increase in the number of gigs; and
about 1830 one coach factory of London supplied several
hundreds of these vehicles to travellers at annual rentals.
And though on the introduction of the railway system long
journeys by road were unnecessary, these gigs were found of
great use in town and suburban journeys, and in London
they may be seen by hundreds daily, and they are scarcely
used by any one else but commercial travellers. They are
too familiar to need detailed description.</p>

<p>In 1810 a duty was levied by Government upon vehicles
for sale. It was repealed in 1825, but the returns give the
number of vehicles built for private use in 1814 as 3,636,
and in 1824 as 5,143, whilst the number of carriages in use
in 1824 had grown to 25,000 four-wheeled, and 36,000 two-wheeled,
besides 15,000 tax-carts; an increase since 1814 of
20,000 vehicles.</p>

<p>In 1824 there was built for George IV. a low phaeton,
called a pony phaeton, which has since become very common,
and has undergone but very little change from the original.
It was a cab shape, half-caned, with a skeleton bottom side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
hung upon four elliptical springs, with crane ironwork back
and front. It was drawn by two ponies; the wheels were
only 21 and 33 inches high.</p>

<p>A carriage had been introduced from Germany, called a
droitska or droskey—an open carriage with a hood, on a
perch, and suspended from C springs. The peculiarity was,
that the body was hung very near the perch, so that the
seat was only 12 inches above the hind axletree, and the
place for the legs was on either side of the perch. The chief
merits of this vehicle consisted in its lightness as compared
with barouches and briskas, and its shortness.</p>

<p>The cab phaeton was invented by Mr. Davies, of Albany
Street, about 1835; it consisted of a cab body with a hood,
hung upon four elliptic springs, and a low driving seat and
dasher, for one horse. It met with great success and was
soon in general use. It was introduced on the continent,
where it became known under the name of “Milord,” and
became the common hack carriage, after which it went out
of fashion with the upper circles. It has, however, been
recently revived under the name of “Victoria.” The Prince
of Wales and Baron Rothschild set the fashion by using
Victorias about 1869, and it really is a very elegant and
useful vehicle.</p>

<p>In 1839 the first Brougham was built by Mr. Robinson,
of Mount Street, for Lord Brougham, since when this has
become the most common and the most fashionable vehicle
in use. The size of the first brougham was in its chief
dimensions similar to those now manufactured; it was hung
on elliptic springs in front, and five springs behind. Coachmakers
seemed to have lavished the greatest care and attention
on these vehicles, in order to turn out the lightest, and
at the same time the most artistic contrivance, and great
success has attended their efforts.</p>

<p>The foregoing is a brief history of vehicular conveyances
from the earliest times to the present. During the last ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
or fifteen years many further improvements have been added,
tending to produce more perfect vehicles in every respect;
but these improvements have been more in matters of detail
than those at the commencement of the century, and hence
are more likely to escape ordinary observation; but the
critical eye will soon discover these changes, and marvel
at the short space of time in which the <em>real</em> work has been
done.</p>

<p>A glance at public carriages may not be out of place.
Hackney coaches were first used in England in 1605.
These were similar to the coaches used by fashionable
people, but they did not ply for hire in the streets, but
remained at the hiring yards until they were wanted. Their
number soon increased, owing to there being a greater number
of persons who wished to hire than could afford to keep
a conveyance of their own. In 1635 the number was
limited to fifty, but in spite of the opposition of the King
they continued to increase in number, and in 1640 there
were 300 in London. In Paris they were introduced by
Nicholas Sauvage, who lived in a street at the sign of
St. Fiacre, and from this circumstance hackney carriages
are called “fiacres” in France. In 1772 the hire of a
fiacre in Paris was one shilling for the first hour and tenpence
for the second. There were 400 hackney coaches in
London in 1662, and the Government then levied a yearly
duty of £5 each upon them. In spite of this their number
had in 1694 increased to 700, a substantial proof of their
usefulness.</p>

<p>In 1703 a stage coach performed the journey from
London to Portsmouth, when the roads were good, in fourteen
hours. From this time there was a gradual increase in
the number and destinations of stage coaches.</p>

<p>In 1755 stage coaches are described as being covered
with dull black leather, studded with broad-headed nails by
way of ornament, and oval windows in the quarters, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the frames painted red. On the panels the destination of
the coach was displayed in bold characters. The roof rose
in a high curve with a rail round it. The coachman and
guard sat in front upon a high narrow boot, sometimes
garnished with a hammercloth ornamented with a deep
fringe. Behind was an immense basket supported by iron
bars, in which passengers were carried at a cheaper rate
than in other parts of the vehicle. The wheels were painted
red. The coach was usually drawn by three horses, on the
first of which a postillion rode, dressed in green and gold,
and with a cocked hat. This machine groaned and creaked
as it went along, with every tug the horses gave, though
the ordinary speed was somewhere about four miles an
hour.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago news and letters travelled very
slowly, the post-boys to whom the letter bags were intrusted
progressing at the rate of three and a half miles an
hour! In 1784 a proposal was laid before Government by
Mr. John Palmer, the originator of mail coaches, to run
quicker vehicles, though at much dearer rates of postage.
This scheme was at first opposed by Parliament, but after
a struggle of some two years, Palmer’s coaches were adopted
for the conveyance of the mails, though the rate at which
these travelled was only six miles an hour for a long time
after their introduction.</p>

<p>A great impetus was given to the production of better
forms of stage coaches by gentlemen taking to drive them
as an amusement, and two clubs were soon formed of noblemen
and gentlemen who took an interest in four-in-hand
driving and in vehicles in general. Several clubs of this
kind are now flourishing to encourage manly sport, and
with the capacity to promote improvements in the form of
the “drag,” as it is now called.</p>

<p>It is to an architect that we owe the invention of the
Hansom cab. The safety consisted in the arrangement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the framework at the nearest part to the ground, so as to
prevent an upset if the cab tilted up or down. The inventor
was Mr. Hansom, the architect of the Birmingham Town
Hall. Numberless improvements have been made on this
idea, but the leading principles are the same.</p>

<p>In 1829 the first omnibus was started in London by
Mr. Shillibeer, who some time previously had been a coachmaker
in Paris. It was drawn by three horses, and carried
twenty-two passengers, all inside. The fare was a shilling
from the “Yorkshire Stingo,” in Marylebone Road, to the
Bank. This vehicle was found too large for the streets of
London, so a smaller one was started, drawn by two horses
and carrying twelve passengers inside. In 1849 an outside
seat was added along the centre of the roof, and by 1857 the
omnibus had become pretty nearly the same form as we now
know it. Our present omnibus is probably the lightest vehicle
of its kind for carrying such a large number of passengers.
Its average weight is about 25 cwt. The London General
Omnibus Company have, on an average, 626 omnibuses
running on week-days, and 6,935 horses to work them.
They build their own vehicles, and each runs about sixty
miles a day, at a speed of about six miles an hour, and
nearly all are supplied with brake retarders, worked by the
foot, which effect a great saving in the strain put upon the
horses in stopping.</p>

<span class="fs80">PREPARATION OF THE DESIGN AND SETTING OUT
THE FULL-SIZED DRAUGHT.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">In coach-building, as in building construction, the first thing
to be done is to prepare a design of the vehicle proposed to
be built according to the requirements of the customer. A
scale of one inch to a foot is a very good one for the purpose,
though the scale drawings are more often made to a
scale of one and a half or two inches to a foot. These drawings
(or draughts as they are technically termed), are prepared
by specially trained draughtsmen, and it requires no mean
skill to produce, on a small scale, a pictorial representation
of the future vehicle, truly proportioned in all its parts, and
a delicacy of touch in order that the parts may not look
coarse. These drawings, if well made (and they generally
are), give a very accurate picture of the carriage, and a
purchaser is generally able from this to say what peculiar
feature he requires, or where he thinks it should be altered;
if he can do this it saves a great deal of trouble in the future,
whilst the coach is being built.</p>

<p>For this work the draughtsman requires a drawing-board
and T square, and two set squares; as he never has
to prepare very large drawings, a board of imperial size will
be amply sufficient, and the T square to have a corresponding
length of blade. T squares are made of a variety of
woods, but the most serviceable is one made of mahogany,
with an ebony edge; the most important consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
being that the edge should be truly “shot” from end to
end. The set squares should either be vulcanite or skeleton
mahogany with ebony edges; the latter are preferable, as
they work more cleanly than the vulcanite, which, unless
kept very clean, are apt to make black smears across the
drawing. In order to fasten the paper down to the drawing
board, drawing pins will be required; they are simple pins
of iron or steel, with a large flat brass head; four is the
number required for each sheet of paper, one at each corner.
A very much better way to fix the paper down is to
“strain” it to the board. It is done in the following
way:—The sheet of paper to be fastened down is
thoroughly well wetted, by means of a sponge or large flat
brush, on one side (which, it does not matter, but see that
your board is perfectly clean before starting); it should then
be left for five or ten minutes for the water to well soak
into the pores of the paper; when this is done, the paper
will be quite limp. Now take a perfectly clean straight edge,
or the back edge of the T square, and turn up one of the
edges of the paper ¼ or ½ an inch against it; along this edge
run a brush charged with glue from the glue pot, or a piece
of ordinary glue dipped into boiling water and rubbed along
the edge will do just as well, and when you think there is
enough sticky matter to promote adhesion between the paper
and the board, turn the edge of the paper back on the board
(without removing the straight edge or T square), and quickly
rub it with the tips of the fingers until it goes down
flat all along without any air bubbles: do this to all four
edges of the paper, and place in a perfectly flat position to
dry; and if the operation has been carefully conducted the
paper will be beautifully flat to draw upon, and there can
be no fear of its shifting. When the drawing is finished,
all that has to be done is to cut round the edges of the paper
just inside the glued edge, and take it off. A little hot
water will take off the glued strip, and take care to wash all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
glue off at the same time, otherwise a smaller piece of paper
might stick in some important part, and the drawing spoilt in
order to detach it.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp90" style="max-width: 50em;" id="fig07">

 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 7.—Coach.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The draughtsman will do well to have a few French curves,
for drawing the “sweeps” or curved lines of the carriage
bodies, and scales of various sizes, which are slips of boxwood
or ivory, on which are marked at the edges various scales,
from ¹⁄₁₆th of an inch to a foot up to 3 inches to a foot; and
last, though not by any means least, a good box of compasses
or mathematical instruments. We shall not discuss the
merits of the various kinds of instruments here, but any one
wishing to go into the matter may do so by reading “Mathematical
Instruments” in Weale’s Series. But we should
strongly advise the draughtsman to go to some good maker,
as bad drawing instruments only lead to bad drawing.</p>

<p>The drawing paper used should be of a kind having a
slight gloss on the surface, like “hot-pressed” paper, but
without its granular texture. This kind of paper is usually
called a “board,” as Bristol board, and kept in various sizes,
and sold by all colour dealers. Various names are given to
it, but it is all pretty nearly alike.</p>

<p>The paper being fastened, the drawing is commenced by
drawing the ground line <span class="allsmcap">A</span> (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig07" class="pginternal">Fig. 7</a>); from that set off the
height that the body is to be from the ground, indicated by
the dotted line <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, and draw the line <span class="allsmcap">C</span>, which is the depth of
the rocker. This latter is the real bottom of the vehicle,
and from it is measured the height of the seat, about 12
inches, shown by the dotted lines on the body. Then from
the seat measure 42 inches, the length of the roof <span class="allsmcap">D</span>. Lay
off 23 inches for the width of the door, and draw <span class="allsmcap">E</span> and <span class="allsmcap">F</span>.
From <span class="allsmcap">F</span> measure 28 inches, the depth of the back quarter <span class="allsmcap">G</span>,
and from <span class="allsmcap">E</span> measure 25 inches, which will give the front
quarter <span class="allsmcap">H</span>. Now the curves or sweeps of the body can be
put in by means of French curves. From the hinge pillar
measure 26 inches, shown by dotted line <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, and this is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
centre of the hind wheel, which is 4 feet 3 inches high.
The spring is 1¼ inches thick, and consists of 5 plates 42
inches long. The opening between the springs is 12½ inches,
the lower one being clipped beneath the axle. Measure
12½ inches from the underside of the axle, which will give the
underside of the top spring. 1¼ inches must also be allowed
for the back bar <span class="allsmcap">J</span>, and the pump-handle <span class="allsmcap">K</span> will be ½ an inch
thick. Then draw the boot <span class="allsmcap">L</span> in such a position that the
front wheels will lock or turn under it freely. This may be
found by drawing a plan of the wheel as shown, and with
the centre of the lock bolt produced to <span class="allsmcap">N</span>, strike the lines <span class="allsmcap">M</span>,
and it will be seen that the wheels will just clear the body,
which is all that is necessary. From this it will be noticed
that the centre on which the fore carriage turns is not in the
same plane as the axle. This is more particularly discussed
in the chapter on wheel-plates. The front wheel is 42
inches high, the springs the same size as the back springs.
The draught may be now completed from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig07" class="pginternal">Fig. 7</a>, after
having settled on the various heights and sizes, and can be
inked in with Indian ink. The dotted lines, being merely
constructional, are rubbed out when the drawing is inked in.
To complete the drawing, the spokes of the wheels must be
shown. These should be neither too many nor too few, but
there is no rule which regulates their number, except that
there should be two to each felloe. Having inked the parts
in and cleaned the pencil lines off, the drawing is ready to
be coloured. The colours applied to the drawing are the
same as will be used for painting the carriage, so we shall
not detail them here.</p>

<p>From this drawing is constructed the full-size draught,
which is prepared before a tool is touched. On the walls of
the body-making shop are large black-boards, 10 or 12 feet
square, and on these the draughts are prepared just in the
same way as described for the scale drawing, except that
all the heights are marked up a vertical line which runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
through the centre of the doorway, and from this the various
widths are also set off. This and the ground line are the
first two lines drawn, and it is imperative that they should
make a perfect right angle with each other, otherwise the
draught will not be true, and the material worked from it
will be wasted. This
full-sized draught requires
the greatest
care in preparation,
as all the patterns to
which the materials
are cut or shaped are
taken from it, even
to the smallest parts.</p>

<p>The full-size draught
also differs from the
scale draught, inasmuch
as all the details
of the construction
of the vehicle are
shown as in the accompanying
cut (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig08" class="pginternal">Fig. 8</a>), which shows the

shows the construction
of a landau. This latter is a representation of the
working draught for the vehicle, and, in fact, is a reduced
copy of what would be drawn upon the black-board in the
shop, except that some of the minor details are omitted to
avoid confusion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br><br>
<span class="fs80">VARIOUS MATERIALS USED IN COACH-BUILDING.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The materials employed in coach-building number a great
many: various kinds of wood—ash, beech, elm, oak,
mahogany, cedar, deal, pine, &amp;c.; hides, skins, hair, wool,
silk, glue, whalebone, ivory, &amp;c.; iron, steel, copper, brass,
lead, tin, glass, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The timber principally used in the construction of carriages
is the ash. This is not an elastic, but rather a tough and
fibrous wood, capable of altering its form by the application
of pressure, and therefore when not in large masses requires
iron plates to secure it. By boiling it becomes very pliable,
and may be formed into almost any shape, provided that it
is not too thick. For this purpose it is better to use steam
than boiling water, as the latter is likely to dissolve and
carry off the gluten which unites the fibres, thus rendering
the timber useless. Some ash timber is white at heart, and
some red; the white is usually the strongest and best.
Some trees which have been grown on hillsides much exposed
to constant winds present a remarkably wrinkled
appearance through their whole length, and it is scarcely
possible to plane their timber smooth; this is the toughest
of all ash timber. Parts of ash-trees are sometimes found of
a yellowish-brown colour, accompanied by a fetid acid
smell. This is sometimes attributed to the effect of lightning,
but more probably it is a putrid fermentation of the sap,
owing to imperfect drying. All other circumstances being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
equal, the timber is best which is cut down when the circulation
of the sap is slowest, as the pores are then open. In
the process of drying or seasoning the bulk diminishes considerably.
One of the qualities which render ash peculiarly
fit for carriage construction is the absence of elasticity, and
consequent indisposition to alter its form by warping or
twisting. It is not well adapted for boards or planks in
which much width is required, as in drying it cracks a great
deal. The diameter of ash-trees used by carriage-builders
varies from 1 foot to 3 feet 6 inches. It should be borne in
mind in cutting ash, that the interior and the outer casing
under the bark are rather softer and less durable than the
parts between them.</p>

<p>Beech is sometimes used by carriage-builders and by
wheelwrights, on account of its cheapness; but it is very
liable to warp and rot, and consequently unworthy of the
attention of the conscientious manufacturer.</p>

<p>Elm is largely used for planking where strength is required.
The grain is wavy, hard to work, brittle, and apt
to split without care. It is not a good surface to paint on,
as the grain shows through several coats of colour. It is
also used for the naves or stocks of wheels.</p>

<p>Oak is used for the spokes of wheels. The best kinds are
made from the timbers of saplings, which are not sawn but
<em>cleft</em>, in order that the grain may be not cut across and
render the spoke unfit to resist the strains it will be subject
to. Spokes are also made from the limbs of large trees.</p>

<p>Mahogany is largely used for panels, as when painted it
shows a very even surface. There are two kinds, the
“Spanish” and the “Honduras.” The former is unfit for
the purposes of the carriage-builder. It is heavy and very
difficult to work, requiring special tools for this purpose, as
the edges of ordinary tools are rapidly destroyed by it.
The Honduras is very much lighter and cheaper than Spanish,
and the grain and colour more even. It takes the sweeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and curves required for body-work very easily. It can be
procured up to 4 feet in width, straight-grained, and free
from knots and blemishes.</p>

<p>A coarse-grained species of cedar is brought from the
same district as Honduras mahogany, and is sometimes used
for panels which have to be covered with leather, &amp;c. Its
extreme porosity renders it unfit for the application of
paint.</p>

<p>Deal is largely used for the flooring of carriages, and for
covered panels, and for any rough work that is not exposed
to great wear and tear.</p>

<p>The wide American pine is chiefly used in very thin
boards to form the covered panels and roofing of carriages.</p>

<p>Lancewood is a straight-grained, elastic wood, but very
brittle when its limit of elasticity is reached. It comes from
the West Indies in taper poles about 20 feet long and 6 or 8
inches diameter at the largest end. It was formerly much
used for shafts, but since curved forms have been fashionable
it has fallen into disuse. It can be bent by boiling, but is a
very unsafe material to trust to such an important office as
the shafts.</p>

<p>American birch is a very valuable wood for flat boarding,
as it can be procured up to 3 feet in width. It is of a perfectly
homogeneous substance, free from rents, and with
scarcely a perceptible pore. It works easily with the plane
and yields a very smooth surface, and the grain does not
show through the most delicate coat of paint. Its chief disadvantage
is its brittleness, which will not permit of its being
used for any but plane surfaces, and some care is required
in nailing and screwing it.</p>

<p>Hides are used chiefly for coverings, but also in some
parts strips are used for the purposes of suspension. The
hides are those of horses and neat cattle. For covering
they are converted into leather by the action of oak and
other bark. They are afterwards smoothed and levelled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the currier, and sometimes split into two equal thicknesses
by machinery. They are then rendered pliable by the
action of oil and tallow, and finished to a clear black or
brown colour as may be required. This is called dressed
leather. For some purposes the hides are merely levelled,
put on wet to the object they are intended to cover, and left
to shrink and dry. Others are covered with a coat of elastic
japan, which gives them a highly glazed surface, impermeable
to water; in this state they are called patent leather.
In a more perfectly elastic mode of japanning, which will
permit folding without cracking the surface, they are called
enamelled leather. They are generally black, but any
colour desired may be given to them. All this japanned
leather has the japan annealed, somewhat in the same mode
as glass. The hides are laid between blankets, and are subjected
to the heat of an oven raised to the proper temperature
during several hours.</p>

<p>The skins used are those of the sheep and goat. The
former are converted into leather by the action of oak bark.
In one form of dressing them they are known as basil leather,
which is of a light brown colour and very soft. Sometimes
they are blacked, and occasionally japanned like the hides.
In all these forms sheep skins are only used for inferior
purposes, as mere coverings, where no strength is required.</p>

<p>Goat skins are used in the preparation of the leather
known as “Spanish” and “Morocco.” They are not
tanned in oak bark like other leather, but very slightly in
the bark of the sumach-tree. They pass through many processes
previous to that of dyeing, for which purpose they are
sewn up with the grain outwards and blown out like a
bladder. This is to prevent the dye from getting access to
the flesh side. This beautiful leather was originally manufactured
by the Moors, who afterwards introduced the process
into Spain, by which means it came to be known under
two names. The English have greatly improved on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
manufacture, so much so that few others can vie with it.
These skins are used for the inside linings of carriages.</p>

<p>Hair is used as an article of stuffing. To give it the
peculiar curl which renders it elastic, it is forcibly twisted
up in small locks, and in that state baked in an oven to fix
it. Horse-hair is the best, being the strongest and longest;
but various other kinds are used. Sometimes it is adulterated
with fibres of whalebone. Doe-hair is also much
used as an article for stuffing, but as it is very short it cannot
be curled, and there is not much elasticity in it.</p>

<p>Wool in its natural state is not used for carriage purposes.
In the form of “flocks,” which are the short combings and
fibres produced in the process of manufacturing it, it is
very largely used for stuffing. In its manufactured state
wool is used in great quantities, as cloth, lace, fringe,
carpeting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The iron used is that known as wrought iron. To judge
of its quality break a piece over the anvil; if it breaks off
brittle it is of no use for the purposes it is required for. If
it is good wrought iron the fracture will present a bluish,
fibrous, silky texture, without any crystalline portions. Inferior
iron will either appear bright and glistening (when it
partakes of the properties of cast iron) or dull and greyish in
tone at the fracture.</p>

<p>It may also be tested by bringing it to a red heat and
bending it, when any flaws, &amp;c., will at once become
apparent.</p>

<p>Cast iron is also used in the shape of axle-boxes.</p>

<p>Great quantities of wrought iron are used in the construction
of modern carriages. One of the best qualities is that
known as the “King and Queen,” so called from its brand.
This iron is manufactured from pieces of old iron, called
scrap iron, which are placed in furnaces and welded under a
heavy tilt-hammer, after which it is passed between rollers
and converted into bars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>Steel also enters largely into carriage construction in the
shape of springs, &amp;c. Axles are made of Bessemer steel,
and are found to wear very well. Steel consists of iron in
which is combined a large proportion of carbon; the more
carbon the higher the elasticity of the steel. If steel is over-heated,
it gives up a portion of its carbon and approaches
once again its original form of iron.</p>

<span class="fs80">POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE COMMENCING
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CARRIAGE.—COMPONENT
PARTS OF THE BODY.—SMITH’S WORK.—GLUE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">As previously remarked the vehicle is divided into two parts—the
carriage and the body. After the drawing or draught
is carefully worked out to full-size on the black-board in the
shop, with all the curves and sweeps developed, and shown
in elevation and plan, patterns or templates are made from
the draught, and from these the construction of the body
proceeds.</p>

<p>In commencing the construction of a vehicle there are
several things to be borne in mind; such as the purpose to
which the vehicle is to be applied, the size of horses to draw
it, and other considerations arising from these two. It is
popularly believed that the shorter the carriage the lighter it
will run; in ascending an incline this may be true, but on
ordinary level ground a long carriage and short one must be
alike in friction, provided the total amount of weight and
other circumstances be equally balanced.</p>

<p>Another consideration is the height of the wheels. On
level ground, draught is easiest when the centre of the
wheel is a little lower than the point of draught, viz. the
point where the traces are affixed to the collar; but this in
practice would be found rather inconvenient, as very high
wheels would be required, and consequently the height of the
whole vehicle would have to be increased, causing great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
trouble and annoyance in getting in and out of the vehicle, and
the driver’s seat would have to be raised to a corresponding
height. Under equal circumstances a high wheel is more
efficient than a low one, and requires less power to draw it;
though it may be mentioned that a low wheel on a good and
level road will do its work far better than a very much higher
wheel on a rougher road. The sizes of the wheels of two-wheeled
vehicles vary from 3 feet to 4 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>It would be a very good thing if four-wheeled vehicles
were to have the wheels of equal size, in order that the
friction and power might be equal. But with the present
mode of construction this is an impossibility, as we have
only one mode of making the lock or turn. Therefore the
height of the fore wheels must be regulated by the height at
which the body hangs, so that the wheels may pass beneath
it without striking, when the springs play. In practice this
height varies from 2 feet to 3 feet 8 inches, according to the
kind of carriage the wheels are intended for. The hind
wheels vary from 3 feet to 4 feet 8 inches.</p>

<p>The next point is the dishing of the wheel, which is necessary
for strength to take the strain off the nuts, to throw off
the mud and prevent it clogging either the wheel or the
body, and to give greater room for the body between the
wheels without increasing the track on the ground. Whatever
be the amount of dishing or coning, which varies from
1½ to 2½ inches, one rule should always be observed, viz. so
to form the wheel that when running the lower spokes should
maintain a true vertical position both in the fore and hind
wheels. This is mainly accomplished by the dip of the axle,
but if the fore and hind wheels have the same dish, they
will take the same track along the ground. The dish of a
wheel will be understood by referring to <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig10" class="pginternal">Fig. 10</a>, in which it
will be seen that the extremities of the spokes are not in the
same plane, thus forming a dish or hollow in the surface of
the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p>Some ingenious persons have deduced from the foregoing
that a wheel runs best on an axle having a conical arm (the
arm is the extremity of the axle which fits into an axle-box
in the nave or stock of the wheel), in which case the axle
would not dip, but the wheel would be put on to a perfectly
horizontal axle. The motion of a wheel thus placed would
be anything but artistic, though there would not be so much
friction on an arm of this sort as on an arm of the dipped
axle. Dipping the axle is shown at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig10" class="pginternal">Fig. 10</a>. It merely consists
in bending it so far out of the horizontal as to give the
lower spokes a vertical position. But in practice this theory
of the conical arm will not answer, inasmuch as curving the
arm will reduce the front bearing surface so much that the
oil would be squeezed out, and it would run dry, and the
total amount of friction would be greatly increased. Long
practice has shown that a cylindrical or slightly conical arm
is the best that can be used.</p>

 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 10.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We have now to settle the form, combination, and proportion
of the springs. Springs which are laid on the axle at
right angles have to carry the whole of the weight of the
carriage, save only the wheels and axles. Where other
springs are used in addition it is not necessary that the
axle-springs should have much play. It will be sufficient to
give them just so much play as will intercept the concussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
caused by moving over a road. The strength of the
springs must of course be adjusted to the weight they have
to carry, for it is evident that if they be made sufficiently
elastic to carry the weight of six persons, they will be found
hard if only three enter the carriage. This is a disadvantage
all carriages must labour under, for it is ridiculous to suppose
that if a carriage is constructed to hold six that number
will always want to use it at the same time. There would
seem to be room for some improvement in the way of introducing
springs adjustable to any weight, though, to give
spring-makers their due, they do turn out really a first-class
article in this respect; this is more noticeable because it is
so recent. Light carriages are never so easy to ride as heavy
ones, even when the springs are well adjusted, because on
meeting with an obstacle there is not a sufficient resistance
to the bound or jerk upwards of the spring, which makes
riding in a light carriage over a rough road rather unpleasant.</p>

<p>The position of the front wheels next demands attention.
As these have to turn under the body it requires some skill
to fix them, and the play of the springs, the height of the
axletree, and the height of the arch (the portion of the body
under which they turn) have all to be considered. This will
be more particularly described when dealing with wheel-plates.</p>

<p>The rule for the height of the splinter-bar, to which the
traces or shafts are fixed, is that it should fall on a line
drawn from the horse’s shoulder to the centre of the hind
wheel. This, however, is not always convenient in practice,
as the fore wheels regulate the height of the framing of the
under carriage, to which the splinter-bar is fixed. The distance
of the splinter-bar from the central pin, on which the
wheel-plate and fore carriage turn, is regulated by the size
of the wheels and the projection of the driving seat footboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>All the above particulars are considered when setting out
the full-sized draught, and all points capable of delineation are
put on the board in some convenient part. In <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig09" class="pginternal">Fig. 9</a> the
outline is simply given, as to show everything would only
confuse the reader. Such other details as are required are
filled in after the draught has reached the stage shown in the
figure.</p>

<p>It is most necessary for the safe conduct of a coach and
carriage builder’s business that there should be a goodly stack
of well-seasoned timber of the various kinds required, otherwise
great trouble and vexation will arise in the course of
business from a good piece of timber being perhaps spoilt in
working, and there not being another piece in the factory to
replace it.</p>

<p>Where there is sufficient accommodation it is usual for
makers to season their own timber in specially constructed
sheds, which are kept from bad weather, but at the same
time thoroughly well ventilated. In these the timber is
stacked, with small fillets between each plank or board, to
insure a free current of air circulating all round. One year
should be allowed for seasoning for every inch of thickness
in the timber, and none should be used in which this rule has
not been observed.</p>

<p>Thin portions of timber, such as panel stuff and the like,
should be treated in the same way, and in addition the ends
should be secured to prevent splitting. The panel stuff
undergoes another process of seasoning after it is planed up;
in fact, all the thin timber required for roofs, sides, &amp;c.,
does. And about the first thing done in commencing to build
a carriage is for the body-maker to get his thin stuff ready,
as far as planing it up goes, and then to put it aside in some
moderately dry place, with slips of wood between each board
to allow a circulation of air round them. The other stuff
that is likely to be required should also be selected and put
aside. If all these things be strictly attended to, there is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
likely to be much trouble about bad joints; and it will be to
the employer’s interest to look after such workmen who have
not enough scientific knowledge to see the reason of things
themselves, and put them in the right direction. But an
intelligent workman will soon appreciate the advantage of
getting his stuff ready at the commencement, instead of waiting
till he wants to use it.</p>

<p>The parts composing the body may be thus enumerated:—</p>


<p>The frame or case.</p>

<p>The doors.</p>

<p>The glasses, which are fixed in thin frames of wainscot,
covered with cloth or velvet. It is a very good thing to have
india-rubber for these to fall on, and little india-rubber buffers
would prevent them from rattling.</p>

<p>The blinds, which are sometimes panel, but more generally
Venetian, so adjusted with springs that the bars may stand
open at any required angle.</p>

<p>The curtains, of silk, which slide up and down on spring
rollers.</p>

<p>The lining and cushions, of cloth, silk, or morocco, as the
case may be, ornamented with lace, &amp;c. The cushions are
sometimes made elastic with small spiral springs.</p>

<p>The steps, which are made to fold up and fit into recesses
in the doors, or in the bottom, when they are not in use.</p>

<p>The lamps, which are fixed to the fore part of the body by
means of iron stays.</p>

<p>The boot, on which is carried the coachman’s seat.</p>


<p>In carriages suspended from C springs we have in addition:—</p>


<p>The check-brace rings, to which are attached leather braces
from the spring heads, to prevent the body from swinging
too much backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>The collar-brace rings, to which are attached leather braces
from the perch, to prevent the body swinging too much upwards
or sideways.</p><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>


</p><p>The curve or rounding given to the side of the body from
end to end is called the <i>side-cant</i>, and the rounding from the
top to the bottom the <i>turn-under</i>. Some makers arrive at
this curve by framing the skeleton of the body together with
square timber, and then round these off to the required curve
<em>after</em> they are put together. It must be evident to any one
that this proceeding will greatly strain the joints, and under
any circumstances will never give thorough satisfaction or
good results, and the waste of time and material must be very
considerable.</p>

<p>The proper way is to set the curve out beforehand on a
board called the “cant” board, and the method of doing this
is as follows:—</p>

<p>Take a clean pine board, plane it up to a smooth surface.
Shoot one edge perfectly true with a trying-plane. This
straight edge may be taken to represent the side of the
carriage if it were a straight line. Apply this edge to the
full-sized draught, and mark along it the various parts of
the body (see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig08" class="pginternal">Fig. 8</a>, in which the numbered points are
those required to form the side-cant). By means of these
points the required sweep can be set up or drawn, as shown
by the dotted line C in the figure. Now, if you choose, you
can cut away the portion between A and B, and a template
will be formed to which the constructional timbers can be
cut; and it possesses the advantage of being easily applied
to the carriage as it proceeds, to see that the curve is true and
uniform. As this template forms the pattern to which the
timber, &amp;c., is cut, great care is requisite in forming it, so
that it shall be perfectly true.</p>

<p>In order to get the turn-under, the same process is gone
through on another board. This gives what is called the
“standing” pillar pattern, the standing pillar being the upright
timber to which the door is hinged.</p>

<p>There is no rule in particular for determining the amount
of side-cant or turn-under to be given to a vehicle, 2½ or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
3 inches on each side making the outside width of the body;
5 or 6 inches less at the bottom than at the elbow line is a
usual allowance, but this is entirely dependent on the will or
taste of the workman.</p>

<p>The cant-board described above is one having a “concave”
surface; but it quite as often has a convex surface, and
it is just as well to have one of each, and use the convex
for cutting the timbers to, and the concave for trying them
when in place, though, if this be done, it is imperative that
the curves on the two boards should be one and the same.
The same remarks apply to the standing pillar pattern.</p>

<p>The body is a species of box, fitted with doors and
windows, and lined and wadded for the purpose of comfort.
As the greatest amount of strain is put upon the bottom
part, and the forces acting on the other parts are transmitted
to the bottom, it is necessary that it should be very strongly
put together. The two side bottom timbers are bonded, or
tied together, by two cross timbers called bottom bars, which
are firmly framed into them. To give depth to the floor,
without destroying the symmetry of the side, deep pieces of
elm plank are fixed to the inside of the side bottom pieces,
and to these the flooring-boards are nailed, being additionally
secured by iron strap plates, nailed or screwed beneath them.
In the central portion of the bottom sides are framed the
door-posts, called standing pillars. At the angles of the
bottom framework are scarfed the corner pillars. The cross
framing pieces, which connect the pillars, are called rails.
Two of these rails stretch across the body inside, on which
the seats are formed; these are called seat rails. The doors
are framed double, to contain a hollow space for the glasses
and blinds, and they are fastened by means of a wedge lock,
forced into a groove by a lever handle. There is a window
in each door and one in front of an ordinary carriage, say
a brougham. The doors are hinged with secret or flush
hinges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>

<p>Before cutting the timber to the various sizes required,
patterns or templates of all the parts are made in thin wood
from the full-sized draught; also of the various curves likely
to be given to the different parts of the body.</p>

<p>Before a workman could be trusted with the making of a
body, he must of course have considerably advanced in the
knowledge of his craft beyond the mere use of his tools,
because the success of a carriage depends very largely upon
the individual skill of the workman, more so than perhaps
in any other trade.</p>

<p>The stuff is marked out from the thin patterns before
mentioned by means of chalk, and in doing so care should
be taken to lay the patterns on the timber so that the grain
may run as nearly as possible in a line with it, and thus
obtaining the greatest possible strength in the wood, which
lies in the direction of the grain. Thus if the pattern be
straight, lay it down on a piece of straight-grained timber;
if the pattern sweep round, then get a piece of timber the
grain of which will follow, or nearly follow, the line of pattern.</p>

<p>The strongest timber that can be obtained is necessary for
the construction of the hind and front bottom sides; for the
weight is directly transmitted to these, more particularly the
hind bottom sides, where the pump-handles are fixed.</p>

<p>The body-maker, having marked and cut out the various
pieces of timber he will require, planes a flat side to each of
them, from which all the other sides, whether plain or curved,
are formed and finished. They are then framed and scarfed
together, after which the various grooves are formed for the
panels and rebates, for the floor-boards to fit on to. Then, if
there is to be any carved or beaded work, it is performed by
the carver. Previous to being fitted in, some of the panels
have strong canvas glued firmly on their backs, and when
fitted in blocks are glued round the internal angles to give
greater security to the joints, and to fix the panels firmly in
their places. Before the upper panels are put in, the roof is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
nailed on, and all the joints stuck over with glued blocks
inside. The upper panels are then put on, united at the
corners, and blocked inside.</p>

<p>If the foreman who superintends all this be a thoroughly
skilful artisan, and the men under him possess equal intelligence
and skill, the work might be distributed amongst almost
as many men as there are parts in the framework of the body.
These parts will be worked up, the mortises and tenons, the
rabbets and tongues, being all cut to specified gauges; and
when they are all ready it will be found that they go together
like a Chinese puzzle.</p>

<p>The woodwork being completed, the currier now takes the
body in hand, and a hide of undressed leather, specially
prepared for it, is strained over the roof, the back, and the
top quarters of the body whilst in a soft pulpy state, and
carefully sleeked or flattened down till it is perfectly flat.
This sleeking down is a rather tedious process, and takes a
long time and a great amount of care to bring it to a successful
issue; when it is flattened down satisfactorily, it is
nailed round the edges and left to dry, which will take several
days.</p>

<p>Such panels as require bending may be brought to the
required sweep by wetting one side and subjecting the other
to heat, as of a small furnace.</p>

<p>The doors are now made and hinged, and the hollow spaces
intended to hold the glasses and blinds are covered in with
thin boards, to prevent any foreign matter from getting
down into the space, and being a source of trouble to dislodge.</p>

<p>In constructing the body the aid of the smith is called in.
His services are required to strengthen the parts subjected to
great strain, more particularly the timbers forming the construction
of the lower portion. All along each side of the
body should be plated with iron; this should be of the best
brand and toughest quality. It is several inches wide, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
varies from ¼ to ¾ of an inch in thickness. This is called the
“edge plate,” and is really the backbone of the body, for
everything depends on its stability. It should run from one
extremity to the other, commencing at the hind bottom bar,
on to which it should be cranked, and ending at the front
part of the front boot, bottom side. This plate should take
a perfectly flat bearing at every point. Great care must
be taken in fitting it, for although the plate may be of the
requisite strength the absence of this perfect fitting will render
it comparatively weak, the result of which will be found,
when the carriage is completed and mounted on the wheels,
by the springing of the sides, which will cause the pillars of
the body to press on the doors, and it will be a matter of
great difficulty to open them.</p>

<p>In the application of smith’s work to coach-building, it is
often necessary to fit the iron to intricate parts while it is red
hot, and if due precaution be not taken the wood becomes
charred and useless, and in cases where there are glued
joints it may cause the loosening or breaking of these joints
and other material defects. It is an easy matter to have
the means at hand to get over the difficulty. All that is
necessary is to have handy some heat neutraliser. One of the
commonest things that can be used is chalk, and no smith’s
shop should ever be without it. If chalk is rubbed over the
surface to which the hot iron is to be applied it will not char
or burn. Plaster of Paris is a still more powerful heat neutraliser,
and it is freer from grit. A small quantity of the
plaster mixed with water, and worked up to the proper
consistency, will be ready for use in about two hours. Many
smiths will say that they never have any accidents in applying
heated iron, but on inquiry the reason is apparent, for it
will generally be found that such men use chalk, in order to
see that the iron plate takes its proper bearings, thus
inadvertently using a proper heat neutraliser. If it were
more generally known that the difficulty could be met by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
such simple means, there would be less material spoilt in the
smith’s shop.</p>

<p>It has been very common of late years for body-makers to
use glue instead of screws and nails for panel work, &amp;c.;
but it requires a great deal of experience for a man to use
glue with successful results. It is useless for the tyro to try
it; he will only spoil the work. So, unless the artisan be
well experienced in the treatment and application of glue, he
had better leave it alone. To render the operation successful
two considerations must be taken into account. <i>First</i>: To
do good gluing requires that the timber should be well seasoned
and the work well fitted. <i>Second</i>: In preparing for
gluing use a scratch plane or rasp to form a rough surface
of the pieces to be joined together, for the same
purpose that a plasterer scores over his first coat of plaster-work,
in order to give a key or hold. The shop in which
the gluing is done should be at a pretty good temperature,
and so should the material, so that the glue may flow freely.
Having the glue properly prepared, spread it upon the parts,
so as to fill up the pores and grain of the wood, and put the
pieces together; then keep the joints tight by means of iron
cramps where it is possible, and if this cannot be done the
joints must be pushed tightly up, and held till the glue is a little
set and there is no fear of its giving way. All superfluous
glue will be forced out by this pressure and can be cleaned off.</p>

<p>A great cause of bad gluing is using inferior glue and laying
it on too thick. Before using a new quality of glue, the
body-maker should always test it by taking, say a piece of
poplar and a piece of ash, and glue them together, and if
when dry the joints give way under leverage caused by the
insertion of the chisel, the glue is not fit for the purposes of
carriage-building and should be rejected. With good glue,
like good cement, the material should rather give way than
the substance promoting adhesion. This is a very severe
test, but in putting it into practice you will be repaid by the
stability of your work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>


<h4> <i>Waterproof Glue.</i></h4>

<p>It is often found that joints glued together will allow water
to dissolve the glue, and thereby destroy its adhesive power.
It may have been well painted and every care taken to make
it impervious to water, but owing to its exposed position
water has managed to get in. Often where screws are put
in the glue around them will be dissolved, caused by the
screws sweating; and it is very often found, where the screws
are inserted in a panel, that the glue loses its strength and
allows the joint to open, and there is little or no appearance
of glue on the wood, which shows that it has been absorbed
by the moisture.</p>

<p>To render ordinary glue insoluble, the water with which it
is mixed should have a little bichromate of potash dissolved
in it. Chromic acid has the property of rendering glue or
gelatine insoluble. And, as the operation of heating the glue pot
is conducted in the light, no special exposure of the pieces
joined is necessary.</p>

<p>Glue prepared in this manner is preferable in gluing the
panels on bodies, which are liable to the action of water or
damp. The strength of the glue is not affected by the addition
of the potash.</p>

<p>In plugging screw holes glue the edge of the plug; put no
glue into the hole. By this means the surplus glue is left
on the surface, and if the plug does not hit the screw it will
seldom show.</p>

<p>Where brads are used the heads should be well set in;
then pass a sponge well saturated with hot water over them,
filling the holes with water. This brings the wood more to
its natural position, and it closes by degrees over the brad
heads. The brad must have a chance to expand, when exposed
to the heat of the sun, without hitting the putty stopping;
if it does it will force the putty out so as to show, by
disturbing the surface, after the work is finished.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">We have now to consider the construction of the lower
framework, or <i>carriage</i>.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the chief parts of a <i>coach</i>, as
generally known:—</p>


<p class="listhang">Wheels.</p>

<p class="listhang">Axles.</p>

<p class="listhang">Springs.</p>

<p class="listhang">Beds, or cross framing timbers, which are technically
termed the fore axle bed, the hind axle bed, fore
spring bed or transom, hind spring bed, and horn
bar.</p>

<p class="listhang">Perch, or central longitudinal timber connecting the
axletrees.</p>

<p class="listhang">Wings, which are spreading sides, hooped to the perch and framed to the hind beds.</p>

<p class="listhang">Nunters, or small framing pieces, which help to bind the hind beds together.</p>

<p class="listhang">Hooping-piece. A piece of timber scarped and hooped to the fore end of the perch to secure it to the</p>

<p class="listhang">Wheel plate, which is the circular iron beneath which the fore carriage turns.</p>


<p>The fore carriage consists of the fore axle beds, into which
are framed the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>


<p class="listhang">Futchells (French, <i lang="fr">fourchil</i>, a fork), which are the longitudinal timbers supporting the</p>

<p class="listhang">Splinter-bar and the</p>

<p class="listhang">Pole, to which the horses are attached.</p>


<p>The hinder ends of the futchells support the</p>


<p class="listhang">Sway-bar—a circular piece of timber working beneath the wheel-plate.</p>


<p>A circular piece of timber of smaller size, supported on the
fore part of the futchells for a similar purpose, is called the</p>


<p class="listhang">Felloe-piece (often made of iron).</p>


<p>On the splinter-bar are fixed the</p>


<p class="listhang">Roller bolts, for fastening the traces.</p>


<p>On the pole is fixed the</p>


<p class="listhang">Pole hook, to secure the harness.</p>


<p class="listhang">The perch and beds are strengthened with iron plates, where
necessary, and the other ironwork consists of</p>


<p class="listhang">Splinter-bar stays, to resist the action of the draught.
Formerly these were affixed to the ends of the
axles and called “wheel-irons.”</p>

<p class="listhang">Tread-steps, for the coachman to mount by.</p>

<p class="listhang">Footman’s step.</p>

<p class="listhang">Spring-stays.</p>


<p>On the beds are placed</p>


<p class="listhang">Blocks, to support the</p>

<p class="listhang"><span class="special">C</span> springs; to which are attached</p>

<p class="listhang">Jacks, or small windlasses, and</p>

<p class="listhang">Leathern suspension braces.</p>


<p>These parts fitted together would form what is generally
known as a coach, or a vehicle, the body of which is large,
and suspended by leathern braces from the ends of <span class="special">C</span> springs.
They enter into the formation of all vehicles more or less,
but for the other kinds some part or parts are omitted, as in
a brougham hung on elliptic springs, the <span class="special">C</span> springs, perch,
leather braces, &amp;c., would be omitted, and, of course, elliptic
springs and a pump-handle would be added. All the woodwork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
is lightened as much as possible by the introduction of
beading, carving, chamfering, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In starting the carriage part the workman first takes the
perch and planes a flat side to it, and then works it taper
from front to back. The top and bottom curves are then
worked up, or at least some portion of them, and then the
front and hind spring beds are framed on. A pair of spreading
wings are then fitted to the sides of the perch; these are
simply circular iron stays, swelled and moulded to take off
their plainness. A pair is fitted at each end of the perch.
The hind axletree bed is then scarfed upon the top of the
perch and wings, and is connected with the hind spring bed
by two small framing pieces called nunters. At the front
end of the perch a cross bed called a horn-bar is scarfed on
the perch, at the same distance from the fore spring bed as
the hind axle bed is from the hind spring bed, viz. the length
of the bearing of the spring, or about 15 inches. The horn-bar
is connected with the fore spring bed by the two spring
blocks, which are either framed into them or scarfed down
on them, and also by the hooping-piece, which is scarfed on
the top of the perch. The perch is then planed up to the
curve it is to have when finished, and it is then taken to the
smith, who fits and rivets on the side plates, which have ears
at the ends for the purpose of bolting them to the beds. The
carver then does his work by beading the perch and beds,
having due regard to the finish of the parts, rounds and
curves all the ends. On the under side of the perch is
riveted an iron plate, and on this plate is an iron hook for
hanging the drag shoe and chain (if such be used). The hind
framing is now put together, all connections being by means
of mortises and tenons secured by screw-bolts. The wings
used to be, and sometimes still are, of wood, in which case
they are hooped to the perch by iron hoops, and are rebated
to receive the perch plates. The hooping-piece is then
hooped in a similar way to the fore end of the perch, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
transom firmly bolted. The carriage is then turned bottom
upwards, and the smith fits to the fore part the wheel plate
or turning iron, across which runs a broad plate the width
and length of the fore spring bed. A similar plate runs
across the hind spring bed. The hind axle is then fitted to
the wings and perch, and let into its bed at the ends, where
screw clips secure it, the bolts passing through the perch.</p>

<p>The carriage is then turned up into its old position; the
wheel-plate is cased on the top with carved wood, and a
plate is riveted to the side of the horn-bar. The springs are
now fitted to their blocks and bolted firmly down. Iron
stays are bolted to the springs beneath the beds to render
them still firmer. The footman’s step, and the steps for the
coachman to mount to his box by, and other ironwork that
may be required in the shape of stays, &amp;c., are then fixed in
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#39;s Note—original text: thetr" id="THETR">their</ins> place.</p>

<p>The under portion of the fore carriage is framed to the
fore axletree bed, which is a very stout piece of timber.
Through this are framed the two futchells which receive the
pole. The upper part of the axletree bed is covered with a
strong plate to match the wheel-plate. A circular piece of
timber, called a sway-bar, is bolted behind the axletree bed,
and this is also plated beneath for security. In front is a
smaller piece of the same kind, and they both serve for the
circumference of the wheel to rest on. The splinter-bar is
bolted on to the fore end of the futchells and secured by
branching stays, one at either end connecting it with the
axletree bed. As an additional security, iron stays are fitted
to the bottoms of the futchells passing over the axle, which,
in addition to bolts, is secured by screw clips at the ends,
the same as the hind one.</p>

<p>The carriage above described is one suspended only on
<span class="special">C</span> springs. Sometimes elliptic springs are used in conjunction
with <span class="special">C</span> springs, and the former are then termed under-springs.
In the latter case, of the double combination of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
springs, the constructional timbers may be of a less size or
scantling, owing to some of the strain and concussion being
removed. In this case the axles are clipped to the under-springs;
but the general mode of construction is the same.</p>

<p>In first-class work a wrought-iron perch is used instead of
the before described wooden one. This generally follows the
contour of the underside of the body, and is called a swan
neck. It enables the perch to be constructed of a much
lighter appearance, and being really light, and to a certain
extent elastic, all the beds and iron stays may be proportionately
reduced in weight. The wheels and axles also,
having less to carry, may also be made lighter. The system
was introduced by Messrs. Hooper about 1846, and at first
was only applied to broughams and sociables, but it has
gradually been applied to the largest carriages, especially
barouches and landaus. These perches are supported on
horizontal under-springs, and are not now made so light as
at first, for it is found that unless the hind wheels follow
steadily, not only is the carriage heavier behind the horse,
but the perch itself is frequently bent against very small
obstructions; a stronger and stiffer perch is therefore now
used, and it is found easier both to the horse and to the
passengers.</p>

<p>When the body is suspended from <span class="special">C</span> springs by leather
braces, great care should be used in the selection of the
material for these latter, and for this purpose the best and
strongest leather is required.</p>

<p>The use of brake retarders to the hind wheels has now for
some years superseded the old-fashioned drag shoes. It is
evident that the action on two wheels must be better than
on one only. The brake can be applied or removed without
stopping the carriage, which is necessary if a drag shoe be
used. This is rather an important consideration in undulating
country, for it would be a great inconvenience to have
to get down and put on the drag shoe when descending a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
hill, and when at the bottom to stop and get down again to
remove it, in order to proceed along level ground or up the
next hill, and so keep on like this all day. The lever brake
was the original form, as still seen on drags, &amp;c., but in
many parts it is superseded by the foot or treadle brake,
more especially in Scotland. This kind of brake is also the
one used by the London Omnibus Company. The blocks
which press upon the wheels have been made of various
substances—cast iron, wrought iron, brass, wood, india-rubber,
and leather. The wood is the best for the hold on
the iron tyre and absence of noise and smell, but it wears
out fast. India-rubber, especially for light carriages, seems
to be the most satisfactory.</p>

<p>We have given, generally, the operation of framing
together the under or carriage parts of the vehicle. But as
some very important considerations regulate the shape, construction,
and formation of most of these parts, they must be
discussed separately. For this purpose they will be considered
under the following headings:—</p>

<span class="fs80">WHEELS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A wheel for a locomotive vehicle is a circular roller, either
cylindrical or conical, the width or thickness of which is
considerably less than its diameter. It may be either solid
or constructed of various pieces, in which latter case it is
called a framed wheel. It may also be made of wood or
metal, or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Wheels which were made before the introduction of iron
were of course very clumsy in their construction, in order to
obtain the requisite strength. Specimens may still be seen
in the broad wheels of waggons, technically termed rollers.
The naves of these wheels are of enormous size. But when
the naves of wheels were reduced for the purposes of
elegance, a thin hoop of iron was applied both to the front
and back, to prevent them from bursting by the strain on the
spokes. When the felloes of wheels were reduced in size,
straps of iron, called strakes or streaks, were applied to their
convex surfaces covering the joints. But the last improvement
was the most important of all, namely, the application
of a “hoop-tire” instead of what was called the “strake-tire.”
Mr. Felton, in his treatise on coach-building, 1709,
says, “Many persons prefer the common sort of wheel on
account of their being more easily repaired than the hoop-tyre
wheel; but though repairing the latter is more difficult,
they are much less subject to need it.”</p>

<p>The earliest form of wheel was no doubt a slice of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
trunk of a tree; portions of this being cut out for the purpose
of lightening it would be the forerunner of spokes, or we
should think the pieces left running from the nave to the
felloe would be. The only improvement then effected for a
very long period was making them of different pieces of
timber instead of all from one piece, though of course the
proportions of the parts would be considerably improved, if
only for the sake of appearance.</p>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century, among the wealthier
classes, decoration was applied to coaches generally, and
wheels in particular, to an extent which would surprise us
nowadays. These latter were again ornamented as in the
times of the old Roman Empire; the spokes were shaped and
carved, the rim moulded, and the naves highly embossed;
though, as may be imagined, there was a great want of
taste in the application of all this ornament.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century, the extreme
height of wheels extended to 5 feet 8 inches, which had but
14 spokes; wheels 5 feet 4 inches high had 12 spokes;
wheels 4 feet 6 inches had 10 spokes; and the lowest wheels,
3 feet 2 inches high, had 8 spokes. The naves were of elm,
the spokes of oak, and the rims or felloes of ash or beech.
The rims of the higher wheels were often of bent timber, in
two or more pieces, and were bolted to the tires by one
bolt between each pair of spokes. The tire was put on in
pieces, until the hoop-tire came into general use, when it
superseded the old ones entirely. In consequence of the
great height of the wheels it was necessary to make the
carriages very long, and the distance from the front to the
hind axletree was 9 feet 2 inches in a chariot, and 9 feet
8 inches in a coach, or about 8 inches longer than we should
consider necessary now.</p>

<p>These extreme sizes are now very seldom used, except in
the case of large dress or state carriages and coaches.</p>

<p>The form of wheel now generally preferred in practice is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of the dished or conical kind, and the axle-arm on which it
revolves is sloped or bent so far out of the horizontal that
the lower spokes are in a vertical position. Undoubtedly
the friction is increased by this arrangement, because a
wheel on a horizontal axle runs easiest and smoothest; and
when the axle-arm is slanted downwards towards the point
the wheel has a tendency to bind harder against the shoulder
which butts against the nave of the wheel, and the friction
between the two is greater than would be the case if the
axle-arm were perfectly horizontal. This, however, is a very
small objection, inasmuch as this collar is firm and strong,
and well fitted to bear any strain that may be thrown on it
by the wheel; whereas, if the force acted in the other direction,
or against the nuts and linch-pins, there are very few
that would last out a day’s journey. The advantage of
throwing the strain on the firm and strong shoulder, which
is well able to withstand it, is evident; and in this case, in
the event of the nuts or linch-pins falling off or giving way,
there is not so much danger of the wheel coming off at the
moment the nuts go, as its tendency when on a level road is
to run upwards towards the shoulder. Besides this, as the
lower spokes are in a vertical position, the upper ones spread
considerably outwards, and thus afford a greater space for
the body between the wheels without the track on the
ground being increased; and another advantage is that the
mud collected by these conical wheels is thrown off away
from the carriage.</p>

<p>The hind wheels of an ordinary carriage vary from 4 feet
3 inches to 4 feet 8 inches; the fore wheels are from 3 feet
4 inches to 3 feet 8 inches. The number of felloes in each
circumference varies according to the number of spokes,
two spokes being driven into each felloe; 14 to 20 spokes
are a usual number for a hind wheel, 12 to 18 for a fore
wheel; however, there is no rule to guide one in the
matter, experience being the only teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>The wheels should be made with a due regard to the
offices they have to fulfil; but we are inclined to think that
this branch of the trade has not received that careful study
which it deserves. Coachmakers
seem in such a hurry
to produce a perfect vehicle
all at once, instead of beginning
by improving the parts
and then applying these improvements
to the whole.</p>

<p>The mode of constructing a
wheel is as follows:—</p>

<p>The timbers that are to be used should be well and carefully
selected. The nave or stock, which is sliced from the
limb of a tree, should be as nearly as possible the size
required in its natural growth, so that it will
require little reduction beyond what it receives
in the lathe in bringing it up to the true circular
form. The reason of this is that the annual
rings which mark the grain of the timber
should be as little disturbed as possible, as
they are not all of equal strength and durability,
the outer rings being pretty strong, but
as they get nearer to the centre the wood is
much softer. If, then, this outer hard casing
is cut away, even only in part, it is signing
the death-warrant of the poor nave, for the
interior parts of the timber are not nearly so capable of
resisting the destructive influences around, and in a very
short time they will become completely soft and rotten.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" style="max-width: 15em;" id="fig12">
 <img alt="Cross section of Wheel and Axle" class="wd100" src="./A PRACTICAL TREATISE ON COACH-BUILDING _ Project Gutenberg_files/fig12.jpg" id="id-7980600122135797897">
 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 12.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As already remarked, the spokes should be cleft, not cut.
The felloes which form the outer periphery of the wheel
should also be cut as closely following the grain as possible.</p>

<p>When the wheelwright has carefully selected his timbers,
he commences work by turning the stock in the lathe to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
size required. Then he marks with a gauge of the same
width as the spokes 4 circles as shown at <i>a</i> <i>a</i> <i>a</i> <i>a</i>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig13" class="pginternal">Fig. 13</a>.
The first and third of these mark the position of the front or
face spoke, and the second and fourth
mark the position of the back spoke.
Two holes are then bored in each
mortise in succession, after which they
are squared out with proper chisels.
Truth of eye and skill of hand are the
workmen’s only guide in this operation,
though it is evident that it is the most important operation
of the whole, as upon it depend the accuracy and solidity of
the wheel when finished. The tenons of the spokes are
then cut to fit the mortises, parallel in their thickness, but in
width they are cut slightly taper-wise, <i>i.e.</i> the extremity of
the tenon is made about the same size as the mortise, but at
the shoulder it is about one sixteenth of an inch larger,
so as to make sure of the tenon filling the mortise when
driven home.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp30" style="max-width: 25em;" id="fig13">
 <img alt="Mortises for spokes" class="w100" src="./A PRACTICAL TREATISE ON COACH-BUILDING _ Project Gutenberg_files/fig13.jpg" id="id-2697697646555241585">
 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 13.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Before cutting the mortises the stock should be fixed at
some convenient angle, regulated by the amount of dish it is
intended to give the wheel. This is particularly necessary,
or when the felloes come to be fitted, if the mortise-cutting
has been done in a slovenly way, the dish will not exist at
all, or if it does it will be in the wrong direction.</p>


<p>Each alternate spoke is now driven in by the blows of a
mallet to a perfectly close bearing of the shoulder of the
tenon, the workman guiding it as best he
can. But it is evident that the position that
the spokes will take is by no means certain.
Owing to the wedge-like form given to the
tenon, the spokes are driven home very tight,
and wood not being of a homogeneous texture will yield
more in one part than in another; and the mortise, cut in
the way that it is, must be to some extent uncertain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Every alternate spoke being driven, or those in the same
plane, the remainder are driven in between them in the same
manner.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig15" class="pginternal">Fig. 15</a> shows a very handy adjunct to the wheelwright’s
shop; it is called the “centring square.” It is found
extremely useful in marking
and setting out the mortises
for the spokes. Its construction
is very simple, being but
a T square, whose stock is
the segment of a circle. <span class="allsmcap">A</span> is
the blade, <span class="allsmcap">B</span> the circular stock, the extremities of which should
be protected by steel or brass, or, better still, have a steel
edge round the whole of the inner surface of the stock, so
that it will always keep true; for if it wears at all, of course
its true circular form will be destroyed, and it will be rendered
useless. And another important thing should be
borne in mind, and that is to make the upper edge, <span class="allsmcap">C</span>, of the
blade in a line with the centre of the curve from which the
circular head is struck; the reason of this will be apparent
to the most obtuse, for unless the lines radiate from the given
centre it is useless for the wheelwright’s purpose.</p>

<p>After the spokes have been driven in they are shaved off
by the spokeshave to their proper form, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig14" class="pginternal">Fig. 14</a>; and the
lengths being measured from the nave, the outer tenons are
cut, sometimes square, sometimes cylindrical, but leaving the
back shoulder square to abut on the felloe with greater firmness.
In the manner of tonguing there is a great deal of
difference of opinion amongst wheelwrights; that the tongues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
in size should be slightly in excess of the hole or mortise to
receive them, is a generally received idea, but a difference of
opinion exists as to the length. But certainly it seems more
reasonable to cut the tongues a little <em>shorter</em> than the length
of the hole in the felloe to receive them, because when the
tyre is put on it shrinks in cooling and draws up all the
joints. Now suppose the tongues are a little longer than the
holes, the shrinking of the tire causes it to press on these;
and as they are firmly fixed at the nave, there is no escape
for them, and the result is that the spoke is seriously crippled.
It is fair to say that there are many good practical men who
work in this latter way, and with to all appearance good
results, but it is evident that the principle is not a good one.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties in making light carriage wheels is
to get the spoke tightly into the felloe without splitting it,
and the manner of accomplishing this is more successfully
done, not by making the tongue on the spoke so large that it
will fill the hole in the felloe of itself, but by making the
tongue rather smaller and slitting the edges after it has been
driven in, and then wedging up with small wedges, just in
the same manner that a joiner would wedge up the mortises
and tenons of a door.</p>

<p>When the wheel is so far progressed with it is laid on the
ground, and the felloes are ranged round it in the order they
are to be fitted. It is of the greatest importance that the
holes should be bored in the felloe in an exact radial line
from the nave; if this is not done, the spoke will have to be
strained out of the straight line in order to get it into the
hole; this will put an undue pressure upon it, and it is very
likely that before the wheel has been long in use the spoke
will break off short at the felloe. The exact position of all
the mortises and joints should, therefore, be worked out on
a full-sized drawing, and this being accurately done, there
will not be much danger of going wrong. As the construction
of a wheel is somewhat analogous to the arch, it is considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
that by giving the felloes a number of joints the
strength of the wheel is very much increased. Whether this
be so or not must be left to the theorists to determine, as we
have no trustworthy results from the various experiments
under this heading.</p>

<p>The number of felloes in a wheel is decided by its size and
number of spokes, two spokes being driven into each felloe.
For an ordinary-sized brougham the felloes should be seven
in number for the hind wheels, and six for the front wheels,
or fourteen and twelve spokes respectively. For the purpose
of connecting the felloes, a dowel or pin is cut on the end of
one of them, and a corresponding hole bored on another, and
they are fitted together; in common work holes are bored
in each felloe, and an independent pin of hard wood or iron
fitted into them. There is less time and labour consumed in
this latter method; but the felloes constructed on this plan
are not very reliable, and their weakness is soon shown by
what is known as “dropping,” which is simply caused by
the wear and tear to which wheels are subject working the
dowels in the holes and enlarging them (the holes), and
destroying the truth of the joint, which loss is soon discovered
by the play or freedom given to the felloes allowing them to
slip out of their place. But it must be borne in mind that
this defect is just as liable to take place in felloes put together
in the other way if the holes are not truly bored, and the
joints are not well fitted.</p>

<p>The following directions as to putting on the tires
are given in the “Coachmaker’s Handbook,” an American
work:—</p>

<p>“First examine the wheels and see what condition they
are in for the tire, so that we can determine what draught
to give them. See if the felloes are drawn snug on the
shoulder of the spokes, and how much open there is in the
rim; for instance, one set we will suppose to be 1½-inch
felloe, open ³⁄₁₆ of an inch, give a good ¼-inch draught; 1⅜-inch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
felloe, ³⁄₁₆ open, just ¼-inch draught; 1¼-inch felloe, ³⁄₁₆ open,
³⁄₁₆-draught, and so on.</p>

<p>“Now in determining what draught to give the above
wheels, we supposed them all to be good, sound, hard, hickory
felloes; if the felloes are of soft timber just give them a trifle
more draught. If the wheels should be above ¼-inch dish,
the felloes would want only one-half the opening, but give
them the same draught as the above. In running the tire,
lay all the above tire in sets on the floor, roll the wheels on
them, and allow 1 inch for taking up in bending; then mark
the end of the nave with chalk, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., and the tire
with a sharp cold chisel mark I., II., III., IV., &amp;c. Then
straighten on a block set up endwise about 2 feet high, a little
concave or hollow in the centre, letting the helper strike
while the smith manages the tires until the kinks are all
taken out of them. Then bend one end a little, so that it can
be got into the machine, and take pains to get them as round
as possible.</p>

<p>“In running the wheels with a ‘traveller,’ a wedge must
be driven in one of the joints of the felloe for the purpose of
tightening the other joints in the rim. Then get the length
of the felloe, and in running the tire cut it ⅛ inch shorter
than the rim measures. In this explanation we are supposed
to have steel tire, and we have a kind of steel tire
now that is very high and difficult to weld, and there are
many smiths that will profit by this lesson if they attend to
the precaution we give. This tire steel will not stand as
heavy heat as even cast steel, and if it is over-heated in the
least it will crack or break in two while hot.</p>

<p>“There is one peculiar fact connected with it that we find
in no other kind of steel, and that is this: it is apt to slip,
however good the heat, and to obviate this, after scaffing the
ends down to a sharp edge, make a rather sharp lap, and
while hot take a sharp-pointed punch and punch a hole
nearly through both laps, and drive in a sharp pin made of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
³⁄₁₆-inch steel wire and ½ inch long. This will not show on
the outside of the tire when on the wheel, neither does it
weaken the tire like a rivet. We have often seen tires
broken where the rivet went through.</p>

<p>“In welding, first have your fire perfectly clean, the coal
pretty well charred, and the fire hot, but rather small, for
the smaller the fire, if hot, the less it will waste your tire
each side of the weld; have the borax charred; put a little
on the weld while hot, pull the fire open with the poker and
place the lap in the hottest part; roll a few pieces of coked
coal on the weld, blow steadily, carrying your tire back and
forward through the fire, or stop the blast a moment until
the lap is heated alike all through; take it out and weld with
hammer and sledge. With this precaution you will never
fail getting a good welding heat, and need not upset your
tire before welding. If your tire is upset before welding it
makes the lap so much thicker that before it can be heated
through alike there is a liability to over-heat, and waste
away the tire on each side of the weld.</p>

<p>“In laying the tires down the heaviest should be laid at
the bottom, and levelled with brick, so that the tire will rest
permanently on every brick or bearing, and the rest laid on
top the way they will fit best, to prevent warping the tire in
the fire. A level stone should be used to lay the wheel on
when the tire is put on. If the tires do not get warped in
the fire do not hammer them at all, without there are some
kinks left in the tires in fitting them; avoid hammering if
possible, for it marks the tire; cool off, gradually pouring
the water on out of the spout of a tea-kettle until it shrinks
enough so it can be taken up; then roll it in soap-water to
prevent it from hardening, until it is so cool that it will not
burn the felloes, truing up while the helper is rolling it in the
water with a mallet covered with thick leather at both ends;
let the third person take the wheel and finish truing the tire
with a leather-covered mallet; while it is so hot that you cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
bear your hand on it the felloes move easily under the
tire, and it should not be moved after it has cooled off if it
can be otherwise avoided, for this reason, when the tire gets
cold all its roughness and imperfections become embedded
in the felloe.”</p>

<p>“The tire once moved will move the easier next time.
After the tires are all on examine the wheels, and see if
there are any crooked spots in the tire that do not set down
to the rim; should there be any, heat a short piece of iron
and lay on the tire, it will soon heat it enough to burn the
felloe, but take it off before that time, and rap it down with
a hammer. It is a bad practice to heat the tires on a forge
as some do, for in truing them in fitting we have to bend
them cold, and if heated on the forge and one place red hot,
you will often find there a short crook edgewise. If some
of the wheels are dished more than the others, put them on
the off-side of the carriage. Never take a tire off if it can be
avoided, without it is so loose or tight as to spoil the wheel
when run.”</p>

<p>When the tire has got sufficiently cold it is riveted to the
felloe by countersunk rivets, one on each side of the felloe
joints.</p>

<p>The strength or weakness of wheels plays an important
part in the durability of the vehicle, for in whatever manner
the various forces are mechanically met they at last concentrate
themselves on the wheel; it is highly necessary, therefore,
that great pains should be taken in constructing them.
The stock is not necessarily the foundation on which to
build a wheel, and, further, there are many objections to its
being so constituted. In the first place, when its centre is all
scooped out for the reception of the axle-box, and its sides
are mortised out to receive the ends of the spokes, it is
nothing but a mere shell. Every mortise hole is more or
less a receptacle for water, which the best workmanship cannot
wholly exclude; and as one part of the stock is always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
more porous than another, that is the part that will soonest
absorb wet and begin to decay. If, therefore, the stock
could be dispensed with greater durability would be insured.</p>

</figure>

<p>A thoughtful inventor, turning over these things in his
mind, has, during the last few years, produced a wheel of
novel construction, which is found practically to be superior
to the one in common use. All the spokes, instead of being
shouldered down to enter the stock, are made wedge-shaped
at the end, and instead of the wheel being constructed from
the centre to the felloe, it is constructed from the felloe to
the centre. Every felloe is made and fitted with its two
spokes, which, as they converge towards the centre, press
upon each other in such a manner that when the whole
periphery is put together a solid centre is produced by the
spokes themselves, as shown in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig16_17" class="pginternal">Figs. 16 and 17</a>; so that instead
of being dependent on wooden stocks the spokes are dependent
upon each other, and by being tightly wedged together
create a mutual support and resistance. The whole are
secured by two metal flanges, one at the back and one at the
front of the centre of the wheel, which are tightly screwed
up, by which means the greatest amount of solidity is
obtained for the entire structure of the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>This invention is due to the Messrs. McNeile Brothers, of
the Patent Steam Wheel and Axle Company, and it is a significant
fact that wheels similarly constructed have for a considerable
time been adopted by the Royal Artillery; moreover,
they have been extensively used on street cabs, heavy
carts, more particularly the latter, and have invariably maintained
their character for superiority. For ourselves, we can
see that a wheel so constructed must possess peculiar advantages.
There is no stock to rot, and the wheel cannot in
any sense be spoke-bound, as is frequently the case with
wheels of ordinary construction, by the mortise in the stock
and the bore in the felloe not ranging in a true line with the
spoke. In the growing desire to produce wheels of light
construction, great efforts have been made to reduce the size
of the centre, and the inventors of these wheels have been
very successful in obtaining this object. At the centre their
wheels are exceedingly light and ornamental in appearance,
and to render them still more uniform they have shortened
the arm of their axles, and consequently curtailed the length
of the axle-box, so that there is the smallest possible projection
at the centre of the wheel. At the same time all the
advantages and peculiarities of Collinge’s principle are retained.
In the ordinary Collinge axle the bearing is not
upon the whole length of the arm, and practically speaking
Messrs. McNeile have in their axles cut out all that part
which is useless in this respect, so that although their axle-arm
is considerably shorter, the bearing is the same as in
the Collinge axle of ordinary construction.</p>

<p>One of the greatest disadvantages in the manufacture of
wheels is the want of uniformity between one another.
Scarcely any two wheels are alike. Scarcely any spokes in a
wheel radiate alike; some are as much as an inch apart more
than others at the felloe; and as the shrinking of the tire
varies, some wheels, as a consequence, get more dish than
others, the spokes either compressing in the nave mortises,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
or yielding by elasticity in the direction of their length. To
get them at all accurate, it is necessary to employ very skilful
workmen, and as skilful workmen are not so numerous as
they might be, the cost of wheels is very much increased.
Another disadvantage attends them: a workman may put his
work badly together, and there is no means of detecting it
till the wheel is in actual use. A badly framed wheel will
show as well to the eye as a good one, and until it breaks
down, no one, whether maker or customer, can detect the
inaccuracy. Unless the master watches every wheel while
the spokes are driving he can only depend on the good faith
of his workmen.</p>

<p>There is no remedy for this evil except substituting
machines for men’s hands. The machine, if it cuts true once,
will cut true always. Every piece of wood in a wheel ought
to be shaped by machinery. The felloes should be sawn to
their exact size, curve, and length by machine saws; they
should be bored by machine augurs, and rounded by machine
shavers. The spokes should be tenoned by machine saws,
and shaped by machine lathes. The naves should be cut by
a machine lathe, and the mortises in the same cut by a
machine chisel. The spokes should not be driven in by the
irregular strokes of a mallet, but be forced into their places by
the regular pressure of a machine. And when the tire is put
on the wheel should be fixed in a frame, in order to preserve
an exact size and shape. When all these things are done,
we may hope to procure wooden wheels alike in form and
quality, and moreover, accurately circular, which very often
they are not at present. All the machines should be worked
by a steam engine. There is scarcely any article of manufacture
for which there is so large a demand, and there is no
great variation in their mode of construction. Coachmakers
generally seem to cling to the old traditions of their craft with
great tenacity; possibly they think it savours of sacrilege to
let progress enter their workshops too rapidly.</p>

<p>The above remarks may be qualified by stating that some
of the largest manufacturers have introduced machinery,
generally, into the departments in which it is applicable, and
more particularly in the
wheelwrights’ department.
Some years since Messrs.
Holmes, of Derby, had
mechanical appliances
worked by steam power for
the following purposes:—Cutting
tenons on the
spokes, squaring the ends
of the felloes, also regulating
their length according
to the size of wheel required; a narrow upright saw for
cutting curved timber; machine for cutting felloes of the
required size and curve; machine for boring felloes for the
ends of spokes, and many other
appliances for lightening hand-labour
and insuring greater accuracy
in the manufacture. But
workshops filled up in this way
are not yet the rule, though
their number is increasing,
and so are the inventions for
application of mechanical power
to the various processes.</p>

<p>It seems rather paradoxical to state that the dished or
conical wheel is the strongest. But the fact is, its strength
arises from the solid hoop-tyre; with a strake tyre the upright
wheel would be the strongest. When running, the great
lateral strain on the wheel is from the outside. Consequently,
if the wheel be dished in an opposite direction, the thrust
will be in the direction of the greatest resistance. The
spokes cannot yield, because in yielding they would increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the area of the circle, and this the tyre will not permit.
Upon the same principle in carpentry, which constitutes the
curved or cambered beam the strongest, the dished wheel is
stronger than the straight one.</p>

<p>Here is one very important item which must not be overlooked
in the wheelwright department, and that is, the size
of the axle-box. The axle-box is a lining of cast iron, on
which the axle-arm takes its bearing. Two forms of these
are given in Figs. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig18" class="pginternal">18</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig19" class="pginternal">19</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig20" class="pginternal">Fig. 20</a> shows an improved form of stock. It will be seen
it is to be applied to straight wheels, and requires no further
description beyond noting that the stock is not weakened so
much as in the ordinary way by mortising, an iron band, <span class="allsmcap">A</span>,
circumscribing the nave and forming a hold for the spokes.</p>

<p>Wheels should be made with a sufficient number of spokes
to properly divide the space at the felloes, and afford sufficient
support to prevent sinking in between the spokes, and at the
same time avoid too many to weaken the stock. The less
the number of spokes, the stronger the hub and the weaker
the felloe. Judgment should be used in dividing the
difference, so as to make each part of the wheel strong in
proportion.</p>

<span class="fs80">AXLES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">An axle, or an axletree, for a locomotive wheel vehicle, is
that portion of wood or metal, or both combined, which
serves as the axis or centre for the wheels to turn round on.</p>

<p>The name axle-<i>tree</i> at once indicates the substance originally
employed for it, viz. wood. Axletrees are of two
kinds; those which are fixed firmly in the wheels and revolve
in gudgeons beneath the wheels, and those in which the
wheel moves independently of the axle. The former, as
being the rudest, was probably the first kind used. The
earliest fixed axletrees were simply pieces of hard timber,
with the ends rounded down into a conical form, that form
being the easiest to fit to the wheel. Subsequently they
were plated with iron to resist wear.</p>

<p>In the earliest iron axles the conical form was still preserved,
for the obvious reason of easy adjustment to the
wheel. These iron axles were not made in a solid piece,
but were merely short ends bedded in and bolted to a wooden
centre. Examples of these axles may still be seen in heavy
carts and waggons.</p>

<p>The next improvement was to make the axles of a single
bar of iron, and this practice has now become common. An
axle is technically divided into three parts—the two <em>arms</em>, or
extremities, on which the wheel revolves, and the <em>bed</em>, or
that portion which connects the two arms together. The
commonest axles, which are manufactured for the sake of
greater cheapness, are formed of a square bar simply rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
to shape between mill rollers. This iron is uncertain in its
quality, as it is liable to have sand cracks, blisters, and
other imperfections, which cause axletrees when made from
it to break down under strong concussion. To guard against
this, the best axletrees are formed of several flat bars or rods
of iron welded together in a mass; this is technically called
“faggoting.” If you wish to discover whether an axle has
been made in this way heat it to a red heat, and if it has
been faggoted the grain or lines of the rods of iron running
in different directions will be plainly discerned. The size is
regulated by the weight it is intended to carry.</p>

<p>For a very heavy coach from 2 to 2¼ inches in diameter
and 10 to 11 inches long in the arm is a fair size. For light
carriages, both four and two-wheeled, 1½ inches in diameter
and 8 inches length in the arm is a common size. Occasionally some
are made as small as 1¼ inches in diameter. It
should be remarked that a less size of axle would perform
the work required of it if it were stationary, as in mill-work;
but for locomotive vehicles it is necessary to provide against
the greatest concussion they can meet with in ordinary
application.</p>

<p>When iron axles were first used it was customary to drive
an iron ring or hoop, 2 or 3 inches broad, into either end of
the nave, to prevent too rapid wear. This plan is still used
occasionally in heavy carts, but otherwise axles are always
fitted with iron boxes, adjusted to the arms with more or
less accuracy, according to the price and the material used
for lubrication. For the prevention of friction in wooden
axles soap or black-lead is the best materials; for common,
coarse axles, a thick unctuous grease is the best adapted; but
for axles that are accurately made and fitted to the boxes
there is no lubricating material equal to oil of the purest
kind which can be prepared, <i>i.e.</i> freest from mucilage or
gelatine, according as it may be of vegetable or animal
production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>The commonest axles now used are of a conical form, with
a box of plate iron fitted to them. This box is made by
welding the two edges of the iron together in a broad projecting
seam, which helps to secure it to the nave. The
inside of the box is sunk into hollows for the purpose of
holding the lubricating grease. At the upper end of the
arm the axle is left square, and against this a large iron
washer is usually shrunk on hot. Against this washer the
box works. To secure the wheel against coming off a small
iron collar is placed on the reduced outer end of the arm,
and a linch-pin is driven through the arm beyond it.</p>

<p>An improvement on this kind of axle is when the collar at
the upper end or shoulder is made solid by welding, and a
screw nut with a linch-pin through it is substituted for the
collar and linch-pin. These nuts are commonly made six-sided,
with a mortise or slot for the linch-pin through each
side, in order to afford greater facility for adjustment. In
all other particulars this axle is the same as the last, except
that it is occasionally case-hardened to prevent wear and
friction.</p>

<p>In travelling, these axles require to be fresh greased every
two or three days, and the trouble thus caused is very considerable,
besides the risk of omission, in which case the axle
is likely to be entirely spoiled.</p>

<p>The commonest kind of oil axle is called the “mail,” because
the peculiar mode of fastening was first used in the
mail coaches. The arm is not conical, but cylindrical, in the
improved kind. At the shoulder of this axle a solid disc
collar is welded on for the box to work against. Behind
this shoulder collar revolves a circular flange-plate of wrought
iron, pierced with three holes corresponding with holes in
the wheel from front to back, through which long screw-bolts
are driven, and their nuts screwed sufficiently tight
against the circular flange-plate to allow easy motion. The
wheel, when in motion, thus works round the shoulder collar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
while the flange-plate secures it against coming off. This is
not neat or accurate, but it is simple and secure, and no nut
or linch-pin is required to the axle in front, while the front
of the nave can be entirely covered in. When screwed up
for work, a washer of thick leather is placed between the
shoulder collar and the box, and another between the
shoulder collar and the circular disc, which extends over the
whole surface of the back of the nave. The box of this axle
is of cast iron. The front is closed with a plate of metal,
between which and the end of the axle-arm a space is left of
about 1 inch as a reservoir for oil, which is poured in through
a tube passing through the nave of the wheel and closed by
a screw pin. At the back of the box there is a circular
reservoir for oil, ¾ inch in depth and ½ inch wide. When
the wheel is in motion the revolving of the box keeps the
lubricating material in circulation between the two reservoirs;
any portion getting below the arm at the shoulder
gradually works its way out and is wasted. The oil in the
back reservoir does not waste by leakage so rapidly as that
in the front; but when the leather washer becomes saturated
with water the oil is liable, by reason of its lightness, to
float on the water in or about the washer, and thus get
wasted.</p>

<p>This axle requires frequent examination when very much
in use; but as it is neat in appearance, and under ordinary
circumstances tolerably safe in working, and is not very
expensive, it is much used. Both axle-box and axle-arm are
case-hardened.</p>

<p>The other kind of axle used by carriage-builders is that
known as “Collinge’s Patent.” The original intention of
the inventor was to make it a cylindrical arm, with the box
running round it against a coned shoulder, and secured by a
coned nut in front; but, as it was found in practice that a
leather washer was necessary at the shoulder to prevent
jarring, this part of the plan was abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>The commonest form of this axle now in use consists of
a cylindrical arm with a broad shoulder collar. The box is
of cast iron, and the back of it is similar to that of the mail
axle before described. The front of it has a rebate cut in
the box to receive a small conical collar and the screw of an
oil cap. The arm of the axle is turned down in the lathe to
two-thirds of the total thickness from the point where the
rebate of the box begins. A flat side is filed on this reduced
portion, and along it is made to slide a small collar of gun
metal, with a conical face in the interior to fit against the
coned interior of the rebate in the box. Against this collar,
technically called the “collet,” a nut of gun metal is screwed,
and against that again a second nut of smaller size, with a
reversed thread, is tightly fixed. These two nuts, thus
screwed in different directions, become as firm as though
they were part of the axle itself, and no action of the wheel
can loosen them, because the collet, which does not turn,
removes all friction from them. But, as a further security,
the end of the axle-arm projects beyond the farthest nut, and
is drilled to receive a spring linch-pin. Over all a hollow cap
of gun metal is screwed into the end of the box. This
contains a supply of oil for lubricating purposes.</p>

<p>When the wheel is in motion the oil is pumped upwards
from the cap and passes along the arm to the back reservoir,
constantly revolving round the cap with the wheel. If
the cap be too full of oil—that is, if the summit of the
column of oil in the cap be at a horizontal level above the
leakage point at the shoulder—it will pump away rapidly,
and be wasted till it comes to the level of the leak, where it
will be economically used. It is essential to the perfection of
an oil action that the oil should not be permanently above
the level of the leak, but that small portions should be continually
washing up into that position by the action of the
wheel in turning.</p>

<p>In order to insure their greater durability and freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
from friction these axles and their boxes are always case-hardened,
<i>i.e.</i> their rubbing surfaces are converted into steel
to a trifling depth by the process of cementation with animal
charcoal for about two hours, when they are plunged into
water. The boxes are ground on to the arms with oil and
emery, either end being applied alternately, until a true fit
between the two is accomplished.</p>

<p>The mode in which oil acts as a lessener of friction is by
its being composed of an infinite number of movable globules,
over which the fixed surfaces of the arm and box roll without
causing that friction and wearing away which would be the
result of the two iron surfaces worked together without any
lubricant. This saving in the wear and tear of the axle-arm
is accomplished by the destruction of the oil. From this we
deduce that the greater the mass of oil or grease used the
longer will the axle run, and in order to facilitate this as
much as possible there should be so much space left between
the bearing surfaces of the arm and the box as will allow of
a film of oil to be between them.</p>

<p>A highly polished surface is desirable in an axle and box,
as the bearing is more perfect and true. A rough surface is
a surface of sharp angles, which will pierce through the oil
and cause friction by contact.</p>

<p>To guard against the axle running dry, the arm is reduced
in thickness at the centre for about an inch to allow a lodgment
for the oil, and in the process of working this constitutes
a circular pump, which draws up the oil from the front
cap and distributes it over the area of the arms. But this,
of course, will soon run dry, so that the best remedy to prevent
the oil being exhausted and the sticking of the axle-arm
in the box is careful attention.</p>

<p>A danger arising from careless fitting is the introduction of
grit into the box. This grit is composed of small grains
of silex, which is very much harder than iron or steel; the
consequence is that it cuts and scores the bearing surfaces in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
all directions, and keys them firmly together, so that it is
sometimes necessary to break the box to pieces in order to
get it off the arm.</p>

<p>A patent was taken out to remedy these defects by casting
three longitudinal triangular grooves in each box. The
advantages gained by this are, that if grit gets in it finds its
way to the bottom of the grooves and does not interfere with
the action of the wheel, and, moreover, the grooves keep up
a constant surface of oil in contact with the arm, instead of
trusting to the mere capillary attraction. This does not
interfere with the bearing surface in any marked degree.</p>

<p>In order that the axle shall be perfect the following considerations
are necessary:—</p>


<p>That there be sufficient bearing surface for the arm to rest on.</p>

<p>That the box be of a convenient shape for insertion in the wheel.</p>

<p>That as large a body of oil as possible be kept in actual contact with the arm by washing up as the wheel revolves.</p>

<p>That the column of oil may be in no case above the horizontal level of the leakage point while the wheel is at rest.</p>


<h4> <i>Welding Steel Axles.</i></h4>

<p>Many axles are now made of Bessemer steel. Generally
speaking this is neither more nor less than iron, the pores of
which are filled up with carbon or charcoal. The higher the
steel the more carbon it contains. If steel be heated it loses
a portion of this carbon, and the more it is heated the more
it approaches its original state, viz. iron.</p>

<p>The welding of steel axles is said to be considerably assisted
by the use of iron filings and borax. This is only true in
case the steel should be over-heated, and even then only in
degree.</p>

<p>Borax by itself is a very useful adjunct to this process, and
it should have a small quantity of sal-ammoniac added, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
assist its fusion or melting. The furnace or fire, which is to
be used for the welding process, should be clean and free
from new coal, to prevent sulphur getting on the steel. Of
course, all coal has more or less sulphur in it; but iron or
steel cannot be successfully welded when there is much
sulphur in the fire, so it is well to be as careful in this respect
as possible.</p>

<p>Place the ends of the axles in a clean bright fire, heat to a
bright red heat, take them out, lap them over each other, and
give them a few smart blows with the sledge. Now well
cover them with powdered borax, and again put them into the
fire and cover them up with coked coal, give a strong even
blast, and carefully watch the appearance of the steel as the
heat penetrates it, and see that all parts of the weld are
equally well heated. When the heat is raised as high as the
steel will safely bear (this knowledge can only be gained by
experience, so no rule can be given for ascertaining the degree
of heat, as it varies with the quality of the steel) take them
out. Have two men ready to use the sledges. Place the
axles on the anvil, securing them to prevent their slipping, and
while one man places his hammer full on the weld, give the
extremity of the lap or weld a smart blow or two, and if it
adheres then both sledges can be applied until a true and
workmanlike weld is formed.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that when the axles are heated ready
for welding and lapped, a light or a heavy blow, instead of
uniting the laps, only jars them apart. This is a sure sign
that they have been over-heated, and in this case it will be
very difficult to form a weld at all. The only way of getting
over this difficulty is to heat it to as high a degree as
necessary, and put it in a vice and screw it up; the surfaces
will adhere in this way when the other means fail.</p>

<p>Another cause of failure is the too free use of borax. If
too much is used, it melts and runs about in the fire, unites
with the dirt, and generally blocks up the nozzle of the blast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
causing a great deal of trouble to dislodge. If the blast
is not sufficient, then less heat is generated than is necessary,
and it is impossible to form a good weld unless sufficient heat
is applied.</p>

<p>Steel axles do not find great favour with the trade, although
a large quantity of them are used. They are unreliable,
breaking and fracturing without a moment’s warning, whereas
an axle of faggoted iron would only twist under the same
circumstances, and could easily be re-forged and set right
again.</p>


<h4> <i>Setting Axles.</i></h4>

<p>Setting axles is giving them the bend and slope required,
in order to fall in with the principles of the dished wheel.
It is chiefly applied to the axle-arm, and this is the most important
part, setting the beds being mere caprice.</p>

<p>The great object to be obtained is, to give the arm the
right pitch every way, to make the carriage run easy and as
light as possible, even in the absence of a plumb spoke. All
carriages do not look best, when running, with the bottom
spoke plumb or vertical. In some of the heavier coaches or
carriages more slope or “pitch” has to be given to the arm
to carry the wheel away from the body, so as to bring them
to some specified track, in order to suit some particular
customer, so that we must be governed by circumstances.</p>

<p>There is a patent “axle-set,” but it is not of much assistance,
for half the smiths know nothing about it, and if they
did it would not be generally used, as the advantages derived
from its use are not equal to the trouble of using it. Besides,
the wheels are not always dished exactly alike, and it would
require adjusting to each variety of wheel; and again, the
wheels are not always (though they ought to be) ready; and
when the smith knows the sort of vehicle he is working upon
he can give his axles the required pitch, within half a degree
or so, and the patent axle-set is, unfortunately, not capable
of being adjusted to an idea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br><br>
<span class="fs80">SPRINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Springs in locomotive vehicles are the elastic substances
interposed between the wheels and the load or passengers in
order to intercept the concussion caused by running over an
uneven road, or in meeting with any slight obstacle.</p>

<p>A great variety of substances have been used for this
purpose, such as leather, strips of hide, catgut, hempen cord,
&amp;c.; but these have now been totally superseded by metal
springs, so that what is technically understood by the word
“spring” is a plate or plates of tempered steel properly
shaped to play in any required mode.</p>

<p>It is very probable that the earliest steel springs were
composed of only one plate of metal. This was very defective
in its action; and unless it was restrained somewhat in the
manner of the bow by the string, it was liable to break on
being subjected to a sharp concussion.</p>

<p>There is no hard and fast rule by which the spring-maker
can be guided so as to proportion the strength and elasticity
of his springs to the load they are required to bear; and
even were such a rule in existence it would be practically
useless, because the qualities of spring steel differ so much
that what is known in mathematics as a “constant” could
hardly be maintained. The only guide to the maker in this
respect is observation of the working of certain springs under
given loads, such springs being made of a certain quality of
steel, and any peculiar features that appear should be carefully
noted down for future reference and application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>Springs are of two kinds, single and double; <i>i.e.</i> springs
tapering in one direction from end to end, and those which
taper in two opposite directions from a common centre, as in
the ordinary elliptic spring.</p>

<p>The process of making a spring is conducted in the following
manner:—</p>

<p>The longest or back plate being cut to the proper length,
is hammered down slightly at the extremities, and then
curled round a mandrel the size of the suspension bolt. The
side of the plate which is to fit against the others is then
hollowed out by hammering; this is called “middling.”
The next plate is then cut rather shorter than the first; the
ends are tapered down so as not to disturb the harmony of
the curve. This plate is middled on both sides. A slit is
then cut at each end about ¾ of an inch in length and ⅜ inch
wide, in which a rivet head slides to connect it with the first
plate, so that in whatever direction the force acts these two
plates sustain each other. At a little distance from this
rivet a stud is formed upon the under surface by a punch,
which forces out a protuberance which slides in a slit in the
next plate. The next plate goes through precisely the same
operations, except that it is 3 or 4 inches shorter at each
end, and so on with as many plates as the spring is to consist
of. The last plate, like the first, is of course only middled
on one side.</p>

<p>The plates of which the spring is to be composed having
thus been prepared, have next to undergo the process of
“hardening” and “tempering.” This is a very important
branch of the business, and will bear a detailed description.
There is no kind of tempering which requires so much care
in manipulation as that of springs. It is necessary that the
plates be carefully forged, not over-heated, and not hammered
too cold; one is equally detrimental with the other. To
guard against a plate warping in tempering, it is requisite
that both sides of the forging shall be equally well wrought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
upon with the hammer; if not, the plates will warp and
twist by reason of the compression on one side being greater
than on the other.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a></p>

<p>The forge should be perfectly clean, and a good clean
charcoal fire should be used. Or if coal be used it must be
burned to coke in order to get rid of the sulphur, which would
destroy the “life” of the steel. Carefully insert the steel
in the fire, and slowly heat it evenly throughout its entire
length; when the colour shows a light red, plunge it into
lukewarm water—cold water chills the outer surface too
rapidly—and let it lie in the water a short time. Animal oil
is better than water; either whale or lard oil is the best, or
lard can be used with advantage. The advantage of using
oil is that it does not chill the steel so suddenly, and there is
less liability to crack it. This process is called “hardening.”</p>

<p>Remove the hardened spring-plate from the water or oil
and prepare to temper it. To do this make a brisk fire with
plenty of live coals; smear the hardened plate with tallow,
and hold it over the coals, but do not urge the draught of the
fire with the bellows while so doing; let the fire heat the
steel very gradually and evenly. If the plate is a long one,
move it slowly over the fire so as to receive the heat equally.
In a few moments the tallow will melt, then take fire, and
blaze for some time; while the blaze continues incline the
plate, or carefully incline or elevate either extremity, so that
the blaze will circulate from end to end and completely
envelop it. When the flame has died out, smear again with
tallow and blaze it off as before. If the spring is to undergo
hard work the plates may be blazed off a third time. Then
let them cool themselves off upon a corner of the forge;
though they are often cooled by immersion in water, still it
is not so safe as letting them cool by themselves.</p>

<p>After tempering the spring-plates are “set,” which consists
in any warps or bumps received in the foregoing processes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
being put straight by blows from a hammer. Care
should be taken to have the plates slightly warm while doing
this to avoid fracturing or breaking the plates.</p>

<p>The plates are now filed on all parts exposed to view, <i>i.e.</i>
the edges and points of the middle plates, the top and edges
of the back plate, and the top and edges of the shortest plate.
They are then put together and a rivet put through the
spring at the point of greatest thickness, and this holds, with
the help of the studs before mentioned, the plates together.</p>

<p>It is evident from the above description of a common mode
of making springs, that the operation is not quite so perfect
as it might be. The plates, instead of being merely tapered
at the ends, ought to be done so from the rivet to the points.
And another thing, it would surely make a better job of it if
the plates were to bear their whole width one on the other;
in the middled plates they only get a bearing on the edges,
and the rain and dust will inevitably work into the hollows
in the plates, and it will soon form a magazine of rust, and
we all know what an affinity exists between iron and oxygen
and the result of it; as far as carriage springs are concerned,
it very soon destroys their elasticity and renders them useless
and dangerous.</p>

<p>To prevent oxidation some makers paint the inner faces of
the springs, and this is in a measure successful, but the play
of the spring-plates one upon the other is sure to rub off
some portions of the paint, and we are just as badly off as
ever. A far better plan would be to cleanse the surfaces by
means of acid, and then tin them all over, and this would not
be very expensive, and certainly protect the plates of the
spring longer than anything else.</p>

<p>The spiral springs, used to give elasticity to the seats, &amp;c.,
are tempered by heating them in a close vessel with bone
dust or animal charcoal, and, when thoroughly heated, cooled
in a bath of oil. They are tempered by putting them into an
iron pan with tallow or oil, and shaking them about over a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
brisk fire. The tallow will soon blaze, and keeping them on
the move will cause them to heat evenly. The steel springs
for fire-arms are tempered in this way, and are literally
“fried in oil.” If a long slender spring is needed with a
low temper, it can be made by simply beating the soft forging
on a smooth anvil with a smooth-faced hammer.</p>


<h4> <i>Setting and Tempering old Springs.</i></h4>

<p>In setting up old springs where they are inclined to settle,
first take the longest plate (having separated all the plates)
and bring it into shape; then heat it for about 2 feet in the
centre to a cherry red, and cool it off in cold water as quick
as possible. This will give the steel such a degree of hardness
that it will be liable to break if dropped on the floor.
To draw the temper hold it over the blaze, carrying backward
and forward through the fire until it is so hot that it
will sparkle when the hammer is drawn across it, and then
cool off.</p>

<p>Another mode is to harden the steel, as before stated, and
draw the temper with oil or tallow—tallow is the best.
Take a candle, carry the spring as before through the fire,
and occasionally draw the candle over the length hardened,
until the tallow will burn off in a blaze, and then cool.
Each plate is served in the same way.</p>


<h4> <i>Varieties of Springs.</i></h4>

<p>The names given to springs are numerous, but the simple
forms are few, the greater part of the varieties being combinations
of the simple forms.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illowp90" style="max-width: 40em;" id="fig25_26">
 <img alt="C spring and whip spring" class="w100" src="./A PRACTICAL TREATISE ON COACH-BUILDING _ Project Gutenberg_files/fig25_26.jpg" id="id-1528171909172954789">
 <figcaption class="caption">Fig. 25.<span class="pad45pc"> Fig. 26.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The simple forms are the elliptic spring, the straight
spring, and the regular curve or C spring (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig25_26" class="pginternal">Fig. 25</a>). There
are also one or two forms of spring which have become
obsolete. Such are the whip spring (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig25_26" class="pginternal">Fig. 26</a>), and the
reverse curved spring, which was superseded by the last.</p>

<p>The elliptic spring is the one most commonly used at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
present day. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig27" class="pginternal">Fig. 27</a>, <i>b</i>, shows two of these united at the
extremities by means of a bolt; this is called a double
elliptic spring. The elliptic spring is sometimes used single
in what are called under-spring carriages, where the spring
rests on the axle and is connected with the framework of the
body with an imitation spring or dumb iron to complete the
ellipse. Its technical name is an “under-spring.”</p>

<p>When four pairs of these springs are hinged together so as
to form four ellipses they constitute a set, and are used in
carriages without perches. Their technical name is “nutcracker
spring.”</p>

<p>The straight springs are used in phaetons and tilburies,
and are called “single-elbow springs.”</p>

<p>The double straight spring is used in omnibuses, carts,
&amp;c., where it is fixed across the angle at right angles. It is
called a “double-elbow spring.”</p>

<p>The regular curved spring is in form generally two-thirds
of a circle, one end of which is lengthened out into a tangent,
which serves as a base to fix it by in an upright position;
the body is suspended from the other extremity by means of
leathern braces. Its general figure has caused it to acquire
the technical name of C spring. (See <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig25_26" class="pginternal">Fig. 25</a>.)</p>

<p>The combination known as “telegraph spring” consists
of eight straight springs, when used for a four-wheeled
carriage, and four springs for a two-wheeled carriage. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Stanhope is suspended on four of these springs. Two
springs are fixed longitudinally on the framework, and two
transverse ones are suspended from these by shackles, and
on these latter the weight rests. They will bear a great
weight, and the body has the advantage of being placed two
removes from the concussion.</p>

<span class="fs80">WHEEL-PLATES AND FORE-CARRIAGES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The following is given in the “Coachmaker’s Handbook”
under the heading of “Short and Easy Turning:”—</p>

<p>“To bring a carriage into a different course from a straight
one requires a circular motion, and at half a turn a carriage
has established itself in a right angle to its position when at
rest.</p>

<p>“A two-wheeled vehicle turns on one wheel, which forms
the centre at the place where it touches the ground, and the
opposite wheel forms the circle struck from the said centre.
The body in this instance follows the circular motion exactly
as the axle, and consequently maintains a steady position
above the wheels.</p>

<p>“A four-wheeled vehicle remains in a straight line when
first the front pair of wheels are turned under, then by the
effect of the draught the hind pair of wheels follow in a
wider circle. To effect a turning we bring the front axle
first in a corresponding direction with the desired turn.</p>

<p>“We make distinction between the moment of turning, or
the angular position of the axles previous to the turning
itself, and the effected turning of a vehicle round a centre or
king bolt, according to the construction of the carriage part.
The wheels have to be brought in a position corresponding
with the direction of the turning. The body must be fully
supported after the turning, and the front or dickey of a
carriage must stand in a right angle to fore axletree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p>“We have to consider a few points relative to the height
of the front wheel, and the elevation of the body above the
ground, which averages 30 inches. To give a front wheel
its proper height (between 3 feet 4 inches and 3 feet 6 inches)
and have it turn a full circle, we sweep the body at the
required place, viz. put in the wheel house of a proportioned
length, and a depth between 3 and 4½ inches.</p>

<p>“The front carriage part is fastened round the king bolt,
turning that part horizontal. This action causes the front
wheel to describe a circle, whose diameter is the width of
the track; but as the wheel leans over at the top through
the dish, we have a larger circle in the middle and top of the
wheel. We, therefore, first find a top circle, having a diameter
equal to the width between the highest point of the
wheel, and a side circle following the termination of the
cross diameter of the wheel, having as a centre the king bolt.”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig28" class="pginternal">Fig. 28</a>, which is drawn to quarter-inch scale, the horizontal
line <span class="allsmcap">A</span> is the axletree, <span class="allsmcap">B</span> is the wheel at rest, <span class="allsmcap">C</span> is the
wheel on full lock, <span class="allsmcap">D</span> is the
back of the arch, <span class="allsmcap">E</span> shows the
circle that the wheel will describe
on the ground as it moves
backward, and <span class="allsmcap">F</span> is the circle
the back of the wheel will describe
in the air at the same
movement. It will be seen by
this that when the wheel is on
half lock the back part of it will come in contact with the
arch, and that when on full lock it will have travelled right
away from it. It follows, therefore, that if we want to find
out the right position for the perch bolt to occupy, we must
not measure the circle the wheel will describe on the ground,
but the one described in the air. We must, therefore, measure
along the line <span class="allsmcap">F</span>, and carry that measurement along to <span class="allsmcap">D</span>.</p>

<p>The length of the line <span class="allsmcap">A</span> to <span class="allsmcap">D</span> is exactly 3 feet. Now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
position of the perch bolt, or centre point on which the
wheels lock round, need not be, and in fact very rarely is, in
the same vertical line as the axletree. By compassing the
beds or timbers on which the fore part of the body rests and
through which the perch bolt passes, the centre of the circle
described by the lock may be carried forward. Thus, if the
beds be compassed 4 inches forwards from the straight line <span class="allsmcap">A</span>
along the axle, the centre will be carried forward 4 inches,
the result of which will be, that when on the half lock the
back part of the wheel will be carried away from the arch
2 inches, and that when on the full lock the wheel will
stand 4 inches from the position it would occupy if the bed
were straight. The dotted lines below <span class="allsmcap">F</span> and <span class="allsmcap">E</span> in the figure
show the result of this difference in the shape of the bed;
and it will be seen that to get a 2-inch clearance of the arch
from the back of the wheel without carrying the wheel itself
farther forward than 3 feet from the back of the arch, we
must compass the bed 4 inches, the compass mark being to
the centre of the substance of the bed.</p>

<p>In the fore-carriages for one-horse vehicles, and two-horse
vehicles as well, the shafts are carried by “open futchells”
(<span class="allsmcap">F</span>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig30" class="pginternal">Fig. 30</a>); and in the fore-carriages of two-horse vehicles
the pole is carried by “close futchells” (<span class="allsmcap">F</span>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig31" class="pginternal">Fig. 31</a>).</p>

<p>A reference to the figures will make the following remarks
more clear. The central circle is the wheel-plate, or, as the
Americans term it, the fifth wheel. This is flat at the bottom
and round on the top, and being fitted to the under part of
the top carriage takes its bearing on the bottom carriage,
and by its extended circular formation gives steadiness to
the body when the carriage is running in a straight line, or
when the fore-carriage is on full lock. These bearings are at
the back ends and fore part of the futchells, and at those
points of the bottom bed which are covered by the wheel-plate.
The fore and hind bearings are of ash timber, and
are necessarily circular in form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span></p>

<p>It will be seen how imperative is the necessity of the
wheel-plate being a perfectly true circle and of its taking a
perfectly flat bearing; the forging and finishing such a piece
of work requires, therefore, peculiar care and skill. In the
figure showing the open futchells, the stays which run from
the back end to the front of the futchells are the wheel-irons,
the back-stays, and the bed-clips in one. They clip over the
ends of the bottom bed, and being at these points made flat,
they are cranked downwards to take their bearing on the
spring-block, and here they are fixed to the springs either
by means of bolts passing through them or by clips and
couplings. The best plan is by the latter, as when they are
bolted on holes have to be drilled through the springs, which
renders them weak at these points; the same may be said of
the manner of fixing the bottom half of the spring on to the
axle.</p>

<p>The wheel-iron, bed-clip, and back-stay being in one, a
good opportunity is afforded to the smith to display his
skill and taste, as it is desirable that this piece of workmanship
should be well forged and fitted, and at the
same time a certain grace of outline must be given to it,
otherwise the appearance of the vehicle will be spoiled.
When it is finished it should fall into its position and take
all its bearings accurately without force being used, for if in
bolting on any strain should be put upon it, in order to get
it into its place, it will be liable to snap on meeting with an
obstacle on a rough road.</p>

<p>The English coachsmith ought to possess a better knowledge
of metallurgy than he does. All smiths get a certain
rule-of-thumb knowledge, but what they should possess is a
thorough scientific knowledge of the properties of the metals
they are dealing with. We cannot enlarge here upon the
subject, but the artisan will do well to study a work like
“Metallurgy of Iron,” in Weale’s Series; and if it only teaches
him to tell accurately the good qualities of metal from the bad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
he will have a greater knowledge than a large number of
coachsmiths have. For general purposes it is as well that
he should know that perfectly pure iron is so soft and tough,
and at the same time so malleable, that it can be rolled into
sheets ¹⁄₃₀₀ part of an inch in thickness; and that when wrought
iron can be twisted, cold, into almost any shape without breaking,
he may rest assured that it is as near pure iron as any one
could wish to have for the proper execution of smith’s work.</p>

<span class="fs80">IRON AND METAL-WORK GENERALLY.—LAMPS.—PRINCIPLES
OF COMBUSTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In addition to the foregoing, a large quantity of expensive
ironwork is used in the construction of carriages; the principal
cause of which expense is not the cost of the material,
but the highly skilled labour which is necessary in preparing
it.</p>

<p>In carriages suspended from C springs, the front and hind
wheels are connected by a central longitudinal timber, called
a perch. This has to be plated with iron in order to prevent
its breaking when running over bad ground; and without this
precaution there is great danger of the perch giving way, as
owing to its curved form, which follows the contour of the
body, it is necessary to cut across the grain, and thus weaken
the timber.</p>

<p>These wooden perches have, to some extent, been superseded
by wrought-iron perches, as previously mentioned, and
these have been found to answer admirably.</p>

<p>In C spring carriages there are the loops, which serve to
suspend the body; and these require very good workmanship,
for they are curved in many opposite directions, are tapered
and irregularly formed every way, yet requiring to have
bearing bolts accurately adjusted, and sundry contrivances
for affixing ironwork to them, and all this without a single
square side for the mechanic to work from. They are
samples of great mechanical skill and dexterity of hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>Other carriage ironwork may be generally divided into
stays, plates, hoops, clips, bolts, steps, treads, joints, shackles,
and jacks.</p>

<p>Stays are iron brackets of various forms, bolted by their
extremities to such parts as they are intended to sustain or
strengthen, but they do not take a bearing on any part.</p>

<p>Plates are irons which take a bearing throughout their
length and breadth on the part they are intended to strengthen,
and to which they are fastened by bolts, screws, or rivets.</p>

<p>Hoops are flat straps of iron riveted or welded together,
for the purpose of securing timbers together side by side.</p>

<p>Clips are a kind of open hoops, the ends of which have a
thread run upon them in order to take nuts. The purposes
for which they are used is to screw springs and axles in their
places without having to weaken them by drilling holes
through them.</p>

<p>Bolts are cylindrical pieces of iron of various sizes (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig32" class="pginternal">Fig. 32</a>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
one end of which is flattened out to form a head, and the
other is formed into a screw to receive a nut. The use to
which they are applied is to secure the ironwork and
heavy framework.</p>

<p>Steps may be single, double, or treble. In the two latter
cases they are made to fold up, and are called folding steps,
and may be made to fold up outside or into the body; this
latter is the best way, and if they be well managed they do
not incommode the sitters inside.</p>

<p>Treads are small single steps a few inches square, fixed
for the most part on a single iron stem.</p>

<p>Joints are jointed iron stays, made in the form of the
letter S, and serve to keep the leather heads or hoods of
open carriages, such as landaus, stretched firmly out when
required.</p>

<p>Shackles are iron staples, which serve to receive the
leather suspension braces of C spring carriages on the
springs; they are also used for coupling springs together.</p>

<p>Jacks are small windlasses, which serve to receive the
ends of the leather suspension braces after passing round the
backs of the springs. By means of a wrench or winch
handle the jacks may be wound up or let down so as to
lengthen or shorten the brace.</p>

<p>Then we have the hinges, which are now concealed in the
door pillar, effecting a great improvement in the appearance
of the vehicle, though it necessitates a somewhat stouter
pillar than would otherwise be necessary.</p>

<p>To preserve the ironwork and steelwork of carriages from
rusting, it is either painted or plated with some metal on
which the oxygen of the air does not act. When it is wished
to make it ornamental, carriage ironwork is plated, in which
case it is first covered with a coat of tin laid on by means
of a soldering iron, with rosin and a small portion of sal-ammoniac
in order to promote union between the two metals.
The tin being smoothed, a small portion of silver or brass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
rolled exceedingly thin, is laid on, and by means of the
soldering iron is made to adhere to the tin; more of the
plating metal is then added to join the first by the edges,
till the whole surface is covered. It is then burnished and
polished by means of the proper tools. All articles of iron
requiring to be covered with silver are treated in the same
way; small articles of ornament in brass, which do not
require strength, are cut in solid metal, as it is cheaper by
the saving in labour; but for heavy articles, the weight of
the metal would considerably enhance the price, supposing
that strength were not required. Wheel nave hoops, axletree
caps, loops, brace buckles, check rings, and door handles
are generally plated.</p>

<p>The beading, which is used to cover the joints, is of three
kinds, brass, copper, and plated copper. It is formed by
strips of metal being drawn into a circular or angular form by
means of a die, the hollow space being filled with solder, into
which small pins of pointed wire are fixed to attach it by.
The brass beading is polished; the copper is painted, for
which purpose the surface is roughened. As the quantity of
beading used is often very considerable, the labour of silvering
by means of a soldering iron would be too great, and therefore
the plated or silvered beading is prepared from metal
silvered in the sheet. The process is very simple:—A bar of
copper being reduced to the proper thickness, a bar of silver
is then united to it by means of heat. They are then passed
through the rolls together, and occasionally annealed in the
fire until the requisite thickness be obtained, the two metals
spreading equally. This kind of metal is much used in the
manufacture of carriage lamps.</p>

<p>Several kinds of lamps are used in carriages, both as
regards principle of construction and form and ornament.
In the simplest kind the light is furnished by the combustion
of wax candles, which are contained in tin tubes, through a
hole in the upper part of which the wick passes, the candle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
being pressed upwards as fast as it consumes by a spiral
spring. In dress carriages, where the lamps are somewhat
ornamental, wax candles are invariably used on account of
their superior cleanliness, though the light is inferior to that
of oil.</p>

<p>Oil is often used on account of its superior illuminating
power. The lamp then simply consists of a tin reservoir for
holding the oil, and a round wick of the most ordinary kind,
though sometimes flat for the sake of spreading the flame.
Reflectors of many kinds are used in every variety of carriage
lamps, formed of silvered metal highly burnished.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to bring the argand lamp, with
a current of air through the wick, into use, but sufficient
success has not attended these efforts to make them general,
owing to their liability to be suddenly extinguished by violent
draughts of wind. This may, however, be accomplished
when the scientific principles of combustion and the regulation
of the draught shall be better understood.</p>

<p>By a common lamp is understood one that feeds the wick
with oil by capillary attraction, the column of oil being
below the level of the flame. An argand lamp, on the contrary,
has a column of oil considerably above the level of the
flame and constantly pressing upwards to it like a fountain.
The motion of a carriage has a tendency to make oil at times
flow too rapidly and extinguish the flame, and sometimes to
cause too sudden a rush of air up the central tube, which
blows away the flame from the wick; and when these difficulties
are overcome by ingenuity they become such complicated
pieces of work that it is beyond the ordinary
“gumption” of the servants to trim them properly, and if
this be not done the object of the improvements is defeated.</p>

<p>The principle of constructing an argand lamp, so that it
may regulate its own air draught, is set forth by Lord Cochrane
in one of his patents. It is to divide the lamp into
three chambers—one in the centre, which contains the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
reflectors and light, surrounded by the chimney glass, and
is pierced with holes at the sides to permit the egress of
the heated air and the ingress of the fresh air. From this
chamber a tube or tubes communicate with the lower chamber,
into which the air tube of the burner descends, and thus
furnishes a regulated supply of air. It is evident by this
process the air rushing in must be regulated by the air
rushing out, and <i lang="fr">vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>The flame of the lamp is not produced by oil or tallow
alone, it requires the oxygen of the air to mix with it in
order to sustain combustion. This may be proved by putting
a glass bowl over a candle, when, as soon as the oxygen is
consumed, the light will be seen to go out, the bowl having
the remaining constituent of air left in it, viz. nitrogen, which
will neither support nor assist combustion. Herein consists
the advantage of the argand lamp in furnishing atmospheric
air in the centre of the flame. The flame arising from a
thick wick is hollow, <i>i.e.</i> it is a film of light, like a bladder,
and not continuous, the inner portion of the flame being
filled with gas.</p>

<p>It is well known that if the flames of two candles be
brought in contact they will produce a greater intensity of
light than if burned separately. Upon this principle what
are technically termed “cobblers’ candles” are made. For
the same reason lamps are sometimes made to burn two or
three wicks, placed just so far apart that the flames may
come in contact. This is an approximation to the argand
principle, by admitting air between them. But there is one
difficulty attending them, viz. the regulating of all the wicks
to an equal height, which would be considerable unless the
lamp were so contrived that all could be regulated by one
movement. If this difficulty can be overcome a very excellent
lamp might be made by placing four wicks in a square.</p>

<h3> <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPLES OF COLOURING IN PAINTING.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Colours are distinguished by artists as <em>pure</em>, <em>broken</em>, <em>reduced</em>,
<em>grey</em>, <em>dull</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The pure colours consist of those which are called simple,
or <em>primary</em>; these are red, yellow, and blue; and those which
are formed from their mixture in pairs (binary compounds)
are termed <em>secondaries</em>: such are orange, violet, green, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Broken colours are formed by the mixture of black with
the pure colours, from the highest to the deepest tone.</p>

<p>A <em>normal</em> colour is a colour in its integrity, unmixed with
black, white, or any other colour.</p>

<p>The mixture of equal parts of red and yellow produces
orange; mix equal portions of yellow and blue and we have
green; equal parts of red and blue produce violet. These
are called <em>secondary colours</em>.</p>

<p>Three parts of red mixed with 1 part of blue produce
violet-red; 3 parts of red and 1 of yellow produce a red-orange;
1 part of red to 3 of yellow produces orange-yellow;
3 parts of yellow to 1 of blue produce a light yellow-green;
1 part of yellow to 3 of blue produces a blue-green; 1 part
of red to 3 of blue produces a light violet colour. All these
are called <em>secondary hues</em>.</p>

<p>Normal grey is black mixed with white in various proportions,
producing numerous tones of pure grey.</p>

<p>Lamp and gas-lights throw out yellowish-coloured rays,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
causing a great many light colours to appear different in tone
from what they really are. Certain shades of green and blue
are not easily distinguished by gaslight. A blue fabric will
appear to be green, or of a greenish tone, caused by the
yellow rays falling on it. Green being formed by the mixture
of blue and yellow, whatever contributes yellow to blue,
as in the case cited, or by mixture of pigments, the hue will
be green.</p>

<p>When coloured rays fall on a coloured surface, which is
lighted by diffused daylight, the coloured surface is changed,
the effect being the same as that produced by adding to it a
pigment of the same colour as the coloured light. When red
rays fall upon a black stuff they make it appear of a purple
black; on white stuff they make it appear red; yellow stuff
they make appear orange; and light blue stuff they make
appear violet.</p>


<h4> <i>Complementary Colours.</i></h4>

<p>“The colour required with another colour to form white
light is called the complementary of that colour. Thus
green is the complementary of red, and <i lang="fr">vice versâ</i>; blue is
the complementary of orange, and <i lang="fr">vice versâ</i>; yellow is the
complementary of violet, and <i lang="fr">vice versâ</i>, because blue and
orange, red and green, yellow and violet, each make up the
full complement of rays necessary to form white light.”</p>

<p>These remarks are deduced from experiments with a prism
of glass, giving the spectrum or analysis of the coloured rays
forming white light. When a ray of sunlight is passed
through a triangular prism of flint glass, and the image
received on white paper, it will be noticed that the spectrum
(as the image is termed) consists of several colours—seven
in all. Red, yellow, and blue are the most prominent. The
red rays are modified by the pure yellow, and we have
orange; the yellow rays becoming mixed with the blue become
green; the blue and red give violet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<p>Look intently for a few moments at a bright red object,
then suddenly transfer the gaze to a sheet of white paper;
the paper will appear of a greenish tint. Reverse the process;
look intently at green, then on white paper, and red
will be the tone of the paper. Blue will excite the eye to
see orange, and orange will excite the eye to see blue.
This is called successive contrast. In placing colours near
each other it is of the greatest importance that the painter
should bear in mind the foregoing laws. From these laws
the coach-painter may derive some useful hints. In ornamenting
and striping bear in mind that colours that are
complementary purify each other.</p>

<p>The effect of placing white near a coloured body is to
heighten that colour. Black placed near a colour tends to
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#39;s Note—original text: power" id="POWER">lower</ins> the tone of it. Grey increases the brilliancy and
purity of the primary colours, and forms harmonies with
red, orange, yellow, and light green.</p>


<h4> <i>Chiaro-oscuro and Flat Tints.</i></h4>

<p>“There are two systems of painting; one in chiaro-oscuro
and the other in flat tints. The first consists in representing
as accurately as possible upon the flat surface of canvas, wood,
stone, metal, &amp;c., an object in relief in such manner that the
image makes an impression on the eye of the spectator,
similar to that produced by the object itself. Therefore
every part of the image which receives in the model direct
light, and which reflects it to the eye of a spectator viewing
the object from the same point in which the painter himself
viewed it, must be painted with white and bright colours;
while the other parts of the image which do not reflect to
the spectator as much light as the first must appear in colours
more or less dimmed with black, or what is the same thing,
by shade.</p>

<p>“Painting in flat tints is a method of imitating coloured
objects, much simpler by its simplicity of execution than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
preceding, which consists in tracing the outline of the different
parts of the model, and in colouring them uniformly
with their peculiar colours.”</p>


<h4> <i>Paint Shop.</i></h4>

<p>The paint shop should be a roomy apartment, well lighted
and ventilated. If possible, bodies and carriage parts should
have separate shops to be painted in; the rough work on
bodies, too, ought to have a separate room for its execution.</p>

<p>There should be a good assortment of brushes suitable for
every variety of work, plenty of paint pots, at least two paint
mills, marble slab for mixing colours on, and a stone to be
used exclusively for making putty on; water buckets, sponges,
chamois, palette knives, and putty knives. Light trestles
set on casters for light bodies, and heavy trestles, with two
wheels and a pole, for heavy bodies.</p>

<p>Screens, covered with heavy paper or enamelled cloth, to
protect varnished work from floating particles of dust, and
also from the unsightly marks left by flies, will be found very
useful.</p>

<p>Also the necessary colours; white-lead, whiting, ground
and lump pumice-stone, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The brushes used are of various sizes and have various
names. The largest are used for covering large surfaces with
paint. A smaller kind are called <i>tools</i>, or <i>sash tools</i>, the name
<i>tool</i> being applied more especially to the smaller varieties.
Those brushes used for striping and ornamenting, being very
small, are called <i>pencils</i>. All these are made round and oval,
and filled with various kinds of bristles.</p>

<p>There are also <i>flat</i> bristle brushes of various sizes, which
are useful for body painting. A small variety of these is also
used for painting the carriage parts.</p>

<p>For varnishing, the black sable and badger brushes (both
flat) are handy, though in applying rubbing varnish, the
hair of these is sometimes too soft to lay it on without its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
being thinned with turpentine. But they are capable of producing
very finely finished work.</p>

<p>For painting carriage parts, the medium-sized brushes
should be used. For lead and rough coatings on bodies a
larger brush is required than for carriage parts. Body
brushes should be kept separate from those used for carriage
parts, as the latter wear the brush hollow in the centre, which
unfits them for laying a level coat on the body.</p>

<p>The <i>pencils</i> made of sable, camel, and cow-hair.
Sable-hair is of two colours, red and black, either of which
is superior to any hair now used. The red sable-hair is
rather finer than the black, and is rather better adapted for
ornamenting, while for striping and lining the black sable is
very suitable. Camel-hair pencils work very well for broad
lines. Those made from cow-hair are not much used.</p>

<p>Ornamenting pencils are either made in quills, or tin-bound
with handles. They are of various sizes, suited for the most
delicate touchings or broad handlings. They should be kept
clean, as the smallest quantity of dry paint in them prevents
them working well. When not in use, they should be
greased and put away in such manner that the points may
not be bent.</p>

<p>Lettering pencils, of sable and camel-hair, are commonly
used; they should be from ½ inch to 1 inch long, the shorter
ones being used for filling in after the outlines are traced.</p>

<p>There are three or four kinds of paint mills manufactured.
They vary in size and price, and are suited to the wants of
large or small factories. Where several painters are employed
there should be two paint mills, one kept exclusively for
grinding colours, and the other for lead, filling, pumice-stone,
&amp;c. By this means the colours are not so likely to
be soiled by mixture with lead colours or other rough heavy
paints, which clog the mill up so rapidly.</p>

<p>Paint mills have not penetrated into every workshop yet.
In some is still used the old-fashioned slab and muller; this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
is a more tedious operation, and is not so successfully
accomplished as by the mill.</p>


<h4> <i>Colours.</i></h4>

<p>The colours generally used in the carriage paint shop are
the following:—White-lead, whiting. Yellow ochre and
red-lead, used for rough work. <i>Ground colours</i>, which the
painter uses in combination with other pigments, as chrome
yellow, Indian red, raw umber, Prussian blue, &amp;c. <i>Panel
colours</i>, as carmine, lake of various hues, ultramarine blue,
verdigris, &amp;c.</p>

<p>White-lead is very largely used, not only as a foundation,
but enters into the composition of various colours, as stone,
drab, straw, &amp;c. In the mixture of rough stuff or filling,
white-lead gives elasticity and life to the ochre, and when
properly used forms the tenacious part of the under-coatings.
But oil white-lead should not be used where there is not
sufficient time for it to thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>After a good foundation has been secured, and smooth
coatings of lead are desired, which will sand-paper smoothly
and leave a pleasant surface to colour over, the dry or tub
white-lead should be used. Whiting and white-lead make
a good putty, though it is not so much used as it ought
to be.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chrome Yellow</span> is seldom used clear, except for line-striping.
There are different shades of it as well as qualities,
the best being the cheapest in the end, as it has more body.
Lemon and orange chrome are all the carriage painter
requires; with these he can mix up any hues needed by the
addition of reds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian Red</span> is a strong colour and of great service to the
painter, especially in forming the groundwork for transparent
colours, such as lakes of a reddish or purple cast, and carmine.
Mixed with lampblack, it forms the most durable under coatings
that can be obtained where a brown is needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raw Umber</span> is largely used. With blue and yellow it
forms a pleasant range of quiet greens.</p>

<p>Combined with white and yellow it gives drab tints or stone
colour, which may be toned down by adding black, or
lightened up by vermilion or lake. In mixing a light striping
colour which may have too much of a raw yellow tone, if
a little umber be added the defect is corrected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carmine</span> is a very brilliant colour, surpassing vermilion in
richness of tone, and yet similar to it for height of colour.
It is often adulterated with vermilion, which of course injures
its purity. <i>Pure</i> carmine will dissolve in ammonia water
without leaving any sediment.</p>

<p>Mixed with drabs, delicate greens, asphaltum, &amp;c., carmine
imparts warmth without injuring the colours.</p>

<p>There are several tints and qualities of <span class="smcap">Lake</span>. Those
commonly used are English purple, Munich and Florence
lakes. English purple lake will bear some raw oil in mixing
it; the others are best without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ultramarine Blue</span>, when pure, is a very durable colour.
It is prepared from the mineral <i>Lapis lazuli</i>. Mixed with
the lakes, it tones them down without seriously injuring the
purity of the colour. For clear ultramarine a dark lead-coloured
ground will answer, or make a ground colour of
Prussian blue and white to nearly match the tint of the
ultramarine.</p>

<p>This is rather a difficult colour to handle, but the secret of
laying it on successfully is to have sufficient varnish or boiled
oil in the colour to prevent it “flying off” or drying too
dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Verdigris</span> is an acetate of copper, of bluish colour, and
requires a groundwork. It is not used to any great extent
as a panel colour.</p>

<p>The following is a list of compound colours and their
application:—</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<ul class="colors"><li><i>Pure Grey.</i>—White and black in various proportions.</li>

<li><i>Coloured Greys.</i>—Red and green. Blue and orange.</li>

<li><i>Straw Colour.</i>—White, chrome yellow, and raw umber.</li>

<li><i>Light Buff.</i>—White and yellow ochre.</li>

<li><i>Deep Buff.</i>—White, yellow ochre, and red.</li>

<li><i>Salmon Colour.</i>—White, yellow, and vermilion.</li>

<li><i>Flesh Colour.</i>—White, Naples yellow, and vermilion.</li>

<li><i>Orange.</i>—Equal parts of red and yellow.</li>

<li><i>Pearl Colour.</i>—White, black, and vermilion.</li>

<li><i>Lead Colour.</i>—White and blue, with a little black.</li>

<li><i>Stone Colour.</i>—Black, amber, and yellow.</li>

<li><i>Canary Colour.</i>—White and chrome yellow.</li>

<li><i>Tan Colour.</i>—Burnt sienna, yellow, and raw umber.</li>

<li><i>Pea Green.</i>—White and chrome green.</li>

<li><i>Sea Green.</i>—Prussian blue and yellow.</li>

<li><i>Citron.</i>—Green and orange.</li>

<li><i>Chocolate.</i>—Black and Spanish brown.</li>

<li><i>Olive.</i>—Umber, yellow, and black.</li>

<li><i>Lilac.</i>—White, carmine, and ultramarine blue.</li>

<li><i>Purple.</i>—Olive, red, and carmine.</li>

<li><i>Violet.</i>—Blue and red.</li>

<li><i>Wine Colour.</i>—Purple, lake, and ultramarine blue.</li>

<li><i>Dark Brown.</i>—Vandyke brown, burnt sienna, and lake.</li>

<li><i>Green.</i>—Blue and yellow in different proportions according to the tone required.</li>

<li><i>Marone.</i>—Crimson, lake, and burnt umber.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above list will enable the painter to mix about all the
colours required in coach-painting. A great many shades
may be made of each of those given by varying the proportions
of the component colours.</p>

<p>A good quality of raw linseed oil should be used, as it
works well and dries dead when not used in excess, and it is
free from the gumminess found in boiled oil. Raw oil simmered
over a gentle fire for two or three hours has its drying
qualities improved, more especially if a little sugar of lead be
added to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span></p>

<p>Japanners’ gold size is made as follows:—Asphaltum,
litharge, or red-lead, each 1 oz.; stir them with a pint of
linseed oil, and simmer the mixture over a gentle fire till it is
dissolved and the scum ceases to rise, and the fluid thickens
on cooling.</p>

<p>The quality of the varnish used is very important. Rubbing
varnishes are required to dry firmly in from two to five
days, consequently they have not much oil in their composition.
A good wearing rubbing varnish should not be rubbed
until the fourth or fifth day after being laid on; when rubbed
it should not sweat (become glossy) soon after, even in hot
weather. Slow-drying rubbing varnish, when allowed to
stand a day or so after having been rubbed down, will sweat
out in hot weather, and should again be run over with the
“rub rag” and fine pumice before another coat is applied.</p>

<p>Rubbing varnish that sweats at all times, soon after being
rubbed, is liable to crack and should not be used.</p>

<p>By the use of hard drying varnish the painter is enabled
to level his work down, and prepare for the last coat or
finishing varnish. This last coating must be of an opposite
nature to that on which it is laid if great brilliancy is sought
after; and, as its surface must ever be opposed to the action
of heat and cold, sunshine and shower, it must possess an
elasticity or oily nature that will resist these changes for a
great length of time.</p>


<h4> <i>Painting the Coach.</i></h4>

<p>The body generally receives a coat of priming on the
bottom, top, and inside in the wood shop. This is called
“slushing,” so that when the body arrives in the proof
shop these parts are one coat in advance of the other portions.</p>

<p>The top and the panels require a considerable amount of
attention. If the top is constructed of green timber it will
cause the covering to rise up in ridges or blisters, and when
the canvas is put on, if it is not well stretched when it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
nailed on, the air gets under it and causes a deal of trouble.
The inside of the top should have a good heavy coating of
slush or oil lead to preserve the wood from dampness, and
the outside of the top should be properly primed with clean
smooth lead colour. When this is dry the nail holes should
be puttied in, and sunken places brought forward with firm
drying putty, which will bear blocking down with sand-paper,
leaving the top as level as possible. When this is dusted off
clean, apply a heavy coat of lead in oil, with sufficient varnish
in it to hold the lead together.</p>

<p>The inside of the body should be well coated, as it is a
great protection to the panels. The priming coat should be
composed of the best pure keg lead and oil, with only a small
quantity of drier, and allowed at least a week in which to
dry. This coat should be well worked in to the nail holes
and the grain of the wood. A well-worn springy brush is
the best. When this coating is dry sand-paper it carefully,
and apply a second coat of lead colour, using less oil. The
third day after this, putty the nail holes half full; two after
this, apply the third coat, mixing it so that it will dry firmly,
no oil being used except that which is present in the lead.
When dry, finish puttying the nail holes; also putty up any
of the grain that may appear too open, or else rub into the
grain some lead mixed up very heavy.</p>

<p>The body, after having received three coats of lead, and been
puttied up, may now stand for two or three days. When it
is again taken in hand, sand-paper off any putty that may
be above the level of the surface; dust off, and brush on a
level coat of lead, which must dry hard and firm. Every
coat of lead should be laid on as level as possible, and made
to fill up the grain of the wood as much as possible. These
coats are called “rough stuff.” The body may now stand
for three or four days, when it will be ready for the filling up.</p>

<p>There are two very important things to be studied in coach-painting.
First, to form a surface hard enough to hold out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the varnish and disguise the grain of the wood; and second,
to have the first and intermediate coats of paint sufficiently
elastic to adhere and yield to the natural action of the wood
without cracking or flaking off. In effecting one of these
results we are apt to affect the other; and nothing but the
utmost care, on the part both of the manufacturer of the
essential ingredients and of the person who prepares them for
use, can insure durability.</p>

<p>The leather-covered portions are usually primed with two
coats of black Japan, reduced with a little turpentine.</p>

<p>A good stopping material for nail holes, &amp;c., is made of dry
lead and Japan gold size. It is called “hard stopper.”</p>

<p>The rough coatings should dry firmly, possessing only
sufficient elasticity to bind them to the surface. The first
coat will bear a trifle more oil than the remaining ones, and
should stand about four days before the others are put on,
which can be done every other day.</p>

<p>Five coats of filling up are next added, composed as
follows:—</p>

<p class="noindent filling">
2 parts filling up stuff.<br>
1 part tub lead.<br>
2 parts turpentine.<br>
1 part Japan gold size.<br>
½ „ bottoms of wearing varnish.<br>
</p>

<p>The first coat should cover every portion of the lead
surface, be well brushed in, but not allowed to lie heavy at
the corners. The remaining coats may be applied reasonably
heavy, but kept from lapping over the edges or rounding the
sharp corners, and thus destroying the clean sharp lines of
the body-maker.</p>

<p>Any defects noticed while filling in should be puttied or
stopped, ever bearing in mind that the perfection in finish
aimed at is only secured by care at every step taken.</p>

<p>The leather-covered parts generally have three additional
coats of filling in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>The time allowed for each coat to dry may be extended as
far as convenient, but there is nothing to be gained by allowing
weeks to intervene between the coatings. When a coat
is hard it is ready for another; and it is far better to have the
body filled and set aside than to divide the time between the
coatings, and probably be compelled to rub out the body
before the last coat is firm. Of course, the time occupied by
the coats of filling in to dry varies according to its composition.
If much oil be used, it will take a longer time for each coat
to dry; but the above composition may be applied one coat
every other day.</p>

<p>The first coat may be applied rather thinner than the
others, and is improved by being mixed with a little more
white-lead. It should also be made more elastic than the
succeeding ones, as it will then take a firmer hold on the
“dead” lead coat over which it is placed, contributing a
portion of its elasticity to that coat, and also cling more
firmly to the hard drying coats which follow.</p>

<p>The body having been filled in may be set aside to harden,
or if the smith is ready for it this is the best time for him to
take it in hand, as any dents or burns that he may cause can
now easily be remedied without spoiling the appearance of
the vehicle. Later on, this is a matter of great difficulty, if
not impossibility. Any bruises should be puttied; any parts
which may happen to be burned must have the paint scraped
off bare to the wood. Prime the bare spots, and putty and
fill them to bring them forward the same as the general
surface.</p>

<p>A material has recently been brought into the English
market called “permanent wood filling,” which is confidently
recommended as effecting a saving in time, expense, and
labour, and at the same time more effectually closing the
pores of the wood than the ordinary filling now in use. This
invention is due to a Polish exile named Piotrowski, who
took refuge in America, and there introduced it about 1867,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
since which date it has found its way into the chief carriage
factories in the United States. It is applied to the bare
wood, one coat being given to bodies and two coats to
carriage parts. This closes the pores, holds the grain immovably
in its place, and is so permanent in its effect that
neither exposure to dampness, nor atmospheric changes, nor
the vibrations to which a carriage is so subject can affect the
grain. The satisfaction which this material appears to give
to the Americans, who pride themselves on the superiority
of their carriage-painting, ought to induce our English coach-builders
to inquire after it; for if all that we hear of it be
correct, it must assuredly be a valuable acquisition to the
paint shop.</p>

<p>In rubbing down use pumice-stone. It is best to begin on
top and follow on down, so that the filling water may not
run down on to any part that has been finished. Water
should not stand for any length of time on the inside of the
body; and when the rubbing is completed wash off clean
outside and in, and dry with a chamois kept for the purpose.</p>

<p>The body, when dry, receives a staining coat, and is to be
carefully sand-papered over, the corners cleaned out, and put
on a coat or two coats of dark lead colour, made of tub lead,
lampblack, raw oil, and a small quantity of sugar of lead,
and reduced to a proper consistency with Japan gold size
and turpentine. When dry scratch over the lead colour with
fine sand-paper, which will make it appear of a lighter colour;
we shall then be able to detect any low or sunk places by
reason of the shadow. Putty up any imperfections with
putty made of lead and varnish, and when dry face down
with lump pumice and water. Follow with fine sand-paper,
when the surface will be in a condition to receive the colour
coats. Sometimes, after cleaning off, another coat of dark
lead colour is laid on.</p>

<p>Analysing the foregoing, we find we have used—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p class="noindent pad2">
 1 priming coat of lead (or leather parts, 2 coats of<br>
 <span style="margin-left: 3em;">black varnish instead).</span><br>
 2 thin coats lead colour, and stopped up.<br>
 5 coats of filling up (8 coats on leather parts).<br>
 1 staining coat, rubbed down and cleaned off.<br>
 2 coats dark red colour, stopped up, and carefully rubbed down.<br>
 1 coat dark lead colour.<br>
 —<br>
 12 coats, and ready for colour.<br>
</p>

<p>So much for the body parts. To the carriage parts two
coats of priming are laid on, which are worked in the same
way as those applied to the body. All cavities are then
stopped with hard stopper, to which a little turpentine is
added in order to make it sand-paper easily. Two coats of
quick-drying lead colour are then applied to the wood parts.
The whole is then well sand-papered down, and the grain
should be found well filled and smooth. A thin coat of oil
lead colour is then laid on, and when dry sand-papered
down; any joints or open places between the tire and felloes
of the wheels are carefully puttied up with oil putty. The
carriage parts are then ready for colour. This time we have
applied—</p>

<p class="noindent pad2">
 2 coats of lead priming, stopped up.<br>
 2 coats of lead, thoroughly sand-papered.<br>
 1 coat (thin) of lead colour, sand-papered and puttied up.<br>
 —<br>
 5 coats, and ready for colour.<br>
</p>

<p>The colours are to be ground very fine, kept clean, and
spread on with the proper brushes. If the panels are to be
painted different from the other parts, lay on the black first,
for if any black falls on the panel colour it will occasion some
trouble by destroying the purity of a transparent colour. By
repeatedly turning the brush over while using it, there is less
liability to accidents of this kind.</p>

<p>The colouring of the body is finished as follows:—For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the upper quarters and roof grind ivory black in raw oil to a
stiff consistency, add a little sugar of lead finely ground as
a drier, and bring to the required consistency with black
Japan and turpentine. Lay on two coats of this, and then
two coats of black Japan, and rub down. Then face off the
moulding, and give a thin coat of dead black, after which
apply another coat of black Japan, and flat again. The
whole should then be varnished with hard drying varnish,
flatted down, and finished with a full coat of wearing body
varnish. The varnish should have at least three days to dry;
five or six would be better. The first coat of rubbing varnish
may be applied thinner than the others, in order to avoid
staining the colours.</p>

<p>The pencils used on mouldings should be large enough to
take in the whole width at once, and let the colour run evenly
along, avoiding laps or stoppages, except at the corners, where
it cannot be helped. Avoid the use of turpentine in varnish
if possible; but if the varnish be dark and heavy, sufficient
turpentine added to make it flow evenly will not hurt it. The
half elastic and fine bristle brushes are better for working
heavy varnish than the sable or badger.</p>

<p>In varnishing a body begin on the roof, bringing the varnish
to within 2 or 3 inches of the outer edges. Next, the
inside of doors, &amp;c., then the arch. When these are finished,
start on the head rail on one side, lay the varnish on heavy,
and follow quickly to the quarter. The edge on the roof,
which was skipped before, is to be coated and finished with
the outside, thus preventing a heavy edge. Continue round
the body, finishing the boot last.</p>

<p>The frames and other loose pieces about a coach should be
brought forward along with the body, and not left as is often
done. The frames are most conveniently handled by a device
similar to a swinging dressing-glass; a base and two uprights
stoutly framed together, allowing space for the frame to
swing. It is held in its position by two pointed iron pins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
one fixed and the other movable. This is very convenient
for varnishing, as the painter can examine his work by tilting
it to any angle, and thus detect any pieces of dirt, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the body is to be lake in colour, the lake should be
ground in raw oil, stiff, and reduced with turpentine and hard
drying varnish. The same with dross black and Indian red.
Over lakes and greens two coats of hard drying varnish
should be applied, and one coat of finishing.</p>

<p>If the body is to be blue, mix ultramarine blue with one-half
raw oil and turpentine, and bring it to a workable consistency
by thinning with hard drying body varnish. Give
the body two coats, and after each a slight flatting; then give
two more coats of the same with varnish added.</p>

<p>When Prussian blue is used, two coats are applied, and
white is added, if necessary, to bring it to the required shade.
The blues will dry sufficiently well when merely ground in
raw oil, stiff, and reduced with turpentine, and it is better not
to add a drier over blues; only one coat of hard drying body
varnish should be given, and one finishing coat.</p>

<p>In no case should the painter allow his oil colours to dry
with a gloss. He must always flat them and give them the
appearance of dead colour. This is particularly important,
in case rough stuff or quick-drying colour is to be used
over it.</p>

<p>The carriage parts are finished as follows:—Two coats of
lead colour are first laid on, composed in the same way as
those for the body before the colour is applied. Then stop
all parts requiring it with hard stopper, a little reduced with
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#39;s Note—original text: uprentine" id="URPENTINE">turpentine</ins> to sand-paper easily. To the wood parts apply
two coats of quick lead, composed of dry lead and lampblack
ground in gold size and thinned with turpentine. Sand-paper
down thoroughly, and the grain will be found smooth
and well filled up. A thin coat of oil lead colour is then
applied, and sand-papered down when dry; and at this stage
any open parts between the tire and felloe of the wheels, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
should be again stopped up with oil putty. A coat of colour
varnish follows, then a second, with more varnish added.
The parts are then flatted and striped; another light coat of
clear varnish is given, and after being flatted down the fine
lines are added, and the whole is finished with a good coat of
wearing varnish.</p>

<p>The carriage parts are generally painted one or two tones
lighter than the colour of the panels of the body, except
where the panel colour is of a hue that will not admit of it.
Certain shades of green, blue, and red may be used on panels,
but would not, when made a tint or two lighter, be suitable
for a carriage part. Dark brown, claret, and purple lake
would not be open to this objection, because, to the majority
of persons, they are colours which are pleasing to the eye,
both in their deep and medium tones.</p>

<p>When the panels are to be painted green, blue, or red, and
the painter wishes to carry these colours on to the carriage
part, it is better to use them for striping only, and let the
ground colour be black.</p>

<p>A carriage part painted black may be made to harmonise
with any colour used on the body, as the striping colours can
be selected so as to produce any desired effect. Brilliant
striping can be brought out on dark colours only, while, if the
ground colour be light, recourse must be had to dark striping
colours to form a contrast. The carriage part should not
detract from the appearance of the body; that is, there should
be sufficient contrast between the two to bring out the
beauties of the body. A plainly finished body will appear to
better advantage on a showy carriage, and a richly painted
body on one that is not very ornate.</p>

<p>In striping the carriage parts, the bright colours should be
used sparingly. A fine line placed on the face of the spokes
and naves, and distributed over the inside carriage, would
look far better than when each side of the spokes, the faces,
the naves, and felloes, &amp;c., are striped on both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>The coatings of varnish contribute largely to the durability
as well as beauty of a carriage part. The ground and striping
colours are shown in their purity only after they are
varnished and have a good surface, and the test of wearing
depends on the quantity and quality of varnish applied.</p>

<p>Every carriage part should have at least two coats of <em>clear</em>
varnish. The first coat of varnish to be applied over the
colour and varnish; the second, a good finishing coat,
possessing body, and good wearing qualities. Ground pumice
and water must be used to cut down the varnish, otherwise
the finishing coat will be robbed of its beauty.</p>

<p>In laying on the finishing coat, avoid the extremes of
putting it on too thick or too thin. Lay on a medium coat.
A thin one will appear gritty and rough; and one too heavy
will sink in and grow dim.</p>

<p>From the above description, it will be seen that painting a
coach is a tedious operation, and one which consumes a great
deal of time in its execution; but, if well done, the result
will certainly be very satisfactory. In no case should the
painting be hurried, for by allowing each coat of paint or
varnish sufficient time to dry its durability is insured.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of time is generally spent by the
painter in work which does not really belong to him—that of
mixing and grinding his colours. Where the muller and slab
are used, they occasion a great deal of labour, and the tones
of the colours are liable to be injured by the heat generated
in the process; and even where the hand mills are used, the
process is by no means so cleanly as it ought to be. And
under the heading of waste, this must always be a source of
loss to the manufacturer, for the painter, for fear of not
mixing up sufficient colour for his use, generally prepares too
great a quantity, and as a rule, the surplus is waste, for it is
no use to employ stale colours in painting vehicles, however
well it may do in house painting.</p>

<p>What we want is to have the colours ready ground for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
painter’s hand, and against this has been urged the objection,
that the delicate colours would lose their purity, and all
colours be more or less affected by it. That this is utterly
fallacious is seen by the fact that paints and colours ready
ground and prepared are the rule in America. The invention
of the machinery, &amp;c., for this purpose, is due to Mr. J. W.
Masury, of New York, and he grinds pigments of the hardest
description to the most impalpable fineness without injuring
the tones of the most delicate; and by a process of his own
preserves them, so that the painter has nothing to do but to
reduce them to the consistency he may require for the work
in hand. He says they effect a saving of from 20 to 50 per
cent. both of labour and material. It is difficult to understand
why so valuable an invention is not more general in this
country.</p>


<h4> <i>Irregularities in Varnish.</i></h4>

<p>Varnish is subject to various changes after having been
applied to a body or carriage part. It crawls, runs, enamels,
pits, blotches, smokes or clouds over, and in the carriage
parts gathers up and hangs in heavy beads along the centre
of the spokes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These irregularities will happen at times with the very
best varnish and the most skilled workmanship, and surrounded
with everything necessary to insure a perfect job.</p>

<p>The only reason that can be assigned for it is atmospheric
influence. These peculiarities have occupied a large portion
of the time of the trade, and no other solution has been
arrived at than the above.</p>

<p>The defects of varnishes should be divided into two classes:
those which take place while in the workshop and those
which show themselves after the vehicle has left the hands of
the maker. The defects which show themselves in the
varnish room are those of “spotting,” “blooming,” “pin-holing,”
“going off silky,” “going in dead.” Those which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
take place afterwards are “cracking,” “blooming,” “mud-spotting,”
and loss of surface, sometimes amounting to its
almost total destruction.</p>

<p>The two classes should be considered separately; and
assuming that the workmanship is of the best quality, the
latter class of defects, with the exception of blooming, are in
no way attributable to the varnish; and blooming is caused
by the atmosphere being overcharged with moisture, as would
be the case before a storm, and it is soon remedied.
Cracking will arise from too great an exposure to the sun,
just as any other material will be damaged by unfair treatment.
Mud-spotting will arise from using the carriage in muddy or
slushy roads before the varnish is properly dry. The loss
of surface will depend largely on the coachman, who, from
ignorance or negligence, may rub down the panels of a
carriage until its glossy surface entirely disappears; and if
the stable is contiguous to the coach-house this destruction
will be assisted by the ammoniacal vapours arising from the
manure, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The other defects belong to the inherent nature of the
varnish as at present manufactured, and admitting the
secondary cause to be atmospheric influence, it is necessary
to inquire why it is that varnish should be subject to such
influence. According to the usual way of making varnishes,
we know that various metallic salts and chemical compounds
are used to increase their drying properties. All these will
contain a certain definite amount of water, termed “water of
crystallization.” If deprived of this water they lose their
crystalline form, but they acquire a tendency of again
assuming it by attracting to themselves a proportionate
amount of water when it is brought within their power.
Now the heat employed in making varnishes is sufficient to
expel this water; but the presence of the salts is sooner or
later detected, for when the varnish is applied to the work
these salts absorb moisture from the atmosphere, and by
becoming partially crystallized cause what is known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
“blooming,” “spotting,” and “pin-holing.” The tendency
to bloom will always remain, even after the varnish has
hardened. But if any of these effects take place in the
varnishing room, while the varnish is drying, it will be fatal
to the appearance of the carriage.</p>

<p>To insure as near perfection as possible we want a
substitute for these objectionable driers, which will not be
subject to atmospheric influence.</p>

<h3> <span class="allsmcap">MONOGRAMS.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">At the present time nearly all possessors of carriages have
their private marks painted on some part of the panels.
These take the form of monograms, initial letters, crests, and
heraldic bearings or coats of arms. The monogram is the
commonest. For crests and coats of arms a duty is levied,
from which monograms are free.</p>

<p>A few examples are subjoined. They can be multiplied to
any extent; and designing monograms
and initial letters would be excellent
practice for the apprentice.</p>

the centre of the monogram and balance each other on
either side. In the matter of its colouring, it may be
mentioned that the letters in a monogram are very often
painted all in one colour, and separated at the edges by a
streak of white or high light. Monograms painted in this
manner should be drawn so that the design will not be
confused by ornamentation; that is, the main outlines of
each letter should be distinctly defined, and the spaces must
be so arranged as not to confuse the outlines. The pattern
here given may be coloured carmine,
and the edges separated by straw
colour or blue, and the letters be defined
by canary colour, or a lighter tint
of blue than the bodies of the letters
are painted.</p>

<h3> <span class="smcap">Initial Letters.</span></h3>

<p>A well painted initial letter is certainly quite equal to a
monogram; but then it must be
well painted, because, as it stands
alone, it has only itself to rely
upon for any effect, whereas, in a
monogram, the component letters
mutually assist each other.</p>

have one that agrees in tone with the striping on the carriage
part; that is to say, if blue be used in striping, then use the
same kind of blue for the letter, and so on with other colours.</p>

<p>We may here mention that all this kind of painting is done
on the last rubbing coat of varnish, so that the letters receive
a coat of varnish when the finishing coat is given.</p>

and which blend into each other,
forming a continuous but varied line.
The ornamentation also falls into the

upper and lower ends of the letter
terminate in three stems, covered
by three-lobed leafing, and the main
stem of the letter is preserved in
shape by appearing to grow out naturally
from its outer and inner edges.</p>

<p>Lay in the letter with gold, on which work out the design
with transparent colours. If colours only be employed the
panel colour may be taken as part of the colouring of the
letter; for instance, if the panel be dark
brown, lake, blue, or green, mix up lighter
tints of whichever colour it may be, and
considering the panel colour as the darkest
shade, lighten up from it.</p>

novelty of its ornamentation. The body of
the letter retains its natural outline almost
wholly. From the upper part of the thin
stem springs a scroll, which curves downward,
reaching to the middle of the letter,
and from this grows out a second scroll,
serving to ornament the lower portions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>Lay in the colour in harmony with the striping colour,
deepening the tone of the colour on the stem of the letter, as
shown by the shade lines. The leafing should be made out
with light, medium, and dark tints, blended into each other
so as to avoid the scratchy appearance which an opposite
method produces.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give anything like a comprehensive
series of these in this, or indeed in a very much
larger work, as their number and variety are so great. The

if the student desires to extend his studies in this direction,
most stationers will supply him with sheets of them at a

pencil an inch long. Having traced the

painting the crest, and next the main
upper left-hand division of the scroll

or minor details. It will be noticed
that the centre line of the heavy leafing
is a part of the scroll line, which passes
from the wreath or ribbon at the top,
and is completed at the base; so that
to secure easy curves this line should
be laid in through its whole length, and the leafing or any
minor dividing lines be governed by it. Next lay in the

secured these main curves the subordinate details may be
added.</p>

<p>Where two fine lines cross each other, the effect of one line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>

darker, and as though the lighted line passed over it and cast
a shadow.</p>

<span class="fs80">LINING AND TRIMMING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">This is a department which requires great taste as well as
skill. The interior of a carriage should be lined with cloth
and silk, or cloth and morocco, with laces specially manufactured
for the purpose. The colours should correspond to or
harmonise with the painting. Light drab, or fawn colour,
used to be a very general colour for the linings of close
carriages, such as broughams, because they at once afforded
relief to and harmonised with any dark colour that might have
been selected for the painting. But a severe simplicity of
taste has prevailed of late years in this country, and the
linings of the carriages have been made mostly dark in colour
to correspond to the colour of the painting. This is often
carried to such an extreme as to present an appearance of
sameness and tastelessness. It is no uncommon thing, for
instance, to see a brougham painted dark green, striped with
black lines, and lined with dark green cloth and morocco, with
plain laces to correspond. This to us appears to be only one
degree removed from a mourning coach, and it will be a great
pity if such a taste prevails. On the other hand, violent
contrasts outrage all principles of good taste. Morocco and
cloth, or silk and cloth, of the same colour as the paint may
be used for the linings, but, as the painting should be relieved
by lines that harmonise with it, so should the linings be
relieved by the laces and tufts, which are intended to give
life and character to it.</p>

<p>The back is made with one full row of squares, and two
rows of buttons at the bottom, besides the finishing squares
(see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig50" class="pginternal">Fig. 50</a>), then
the swell of the
back is carried up
to within 4 inches
of the upper edge,
1⅛ inches being
allowed for the
swell. Then the
top of the back is
finished with a
large roll, of about 5 inches swell or girth, so that the back
has only one row of buttons in the upper sweep.</p>

<p>The arm-pieces, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig51" class="pginternal">Fig. 51</a>, are made in a peculiar way, and
the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is rather difficult of explanation. In the
place of the usual arm-piece block, a
piece of plank, 2¾ inches wide by
½ inch thick, is fitted in with the
usual sweep to it. Now fit four
pieces of single fly buckram, to form
as it were a funnel, the shape of the
arm-piece desired; then sew seaming
lace to the two edges of the
funnel, which will show inside of the body; to the lower
edge sew a piece of cloth in smooth, so that it will cover the
bottom of the funnel or cylinder. To the same lace edge,
blind sew in a piece of cloth, for the purpose of forming a
wrinkled roll on the inner face of the funnel, wrinkled
1 inch in fulness for every 3 inches in length, and as full
the other way as desired, for it ought to be full enough to
come out with the bottom side quarter. Next, blind sew
the outer edge of this roll to the other or top seaming lace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and stuff lightly with hair, thus forming one roll on the inner
face, and having the lower face covered with the smooth
cloth.</p>

<p>Now blind sew another piece of cloth to the top lace, as in
the other case, to form another wrinkled roll on top of the
funnel or cylinder, but the outer edge of this roll is to be
finished by nailing to the outside of the piece of plank just
mentioned. All this sewing is of course to be done on the
bench, one side of the funnel to be left open for this purpose.
Next, nail in the bottom side quarter made up in squares, and
then nail the side of the funnel, which is fitted against the
arm-board, to the board and over the quarter, thus finishing
the lower part. Then nail the fourth on top side to the top
edge of arm-board; next, stuff from the front the funnel,
pretty solid, and finish the top roll, which up to now has been
left open, into the outside of the arm-board, thus completing
the arm-piece, which shows two wrinkled rolls divided by two
rows of seaming lace.</p>

<p>The door fall, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig52" class="pginternal">Fig. 52</a>, is made on three fly buckram pasted
together, but one fly is cut off about an
inch from the top to allow the fall to
hinge. The fall is made about 12 inches
deep, the lower edge being circular.
The broad lace is bent to the required
shape, and the corners sewed and put
on to the buckram, which is cut to the
shape intended for the fall. Mark where the inside edge of
the lace comes all round the buckram, then mark 1¼ inches
from the mark; paste a piece of carpet into the buckram
to come within ½ inch from this mark, which will make
the edge of the carpet 1⅜ inches from the edge of the
lace; cover this carpet with a piece of cloth, pasting on
the buckram; take a piece of seaming lace, long enough
to reach round the fall, and sew a piece of cloth to it, for
the purpose of forming a wrinkled roll round three sides of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the fall, inside the broad lace and outside the sewed carpet,
between both, with 1 inch fulness to each 3 inches of
length; sew this seaming lace and roll to the buckram at the
mark, 1¼ inches from the broad lace, gather the other edge
with a running string, and sew down and stuff lightly, finishing
in such a manner that the broad lace shall cover this
sewed edge; next, paste on the broad lace and cover the
wrong side with silk or muslin. When dry, stitch both
edges.</p>

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig53_54" class="pginternal">Fig. 53</a> is made as follows:—Paste out three flies of buckram,
and lay off for block or biscuit pattern, leaving space enough
all round for a broad lace border, and at the top leave double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the space. The top space is formed into a plain cloth roll
of the same goods as the job is trimmed with.</p>

<p>In this case the trimming is brown cloth; the broad lace
is silk and worsted of a shade much lighter than the cloth.
The diamond-shaped and connecting figures are worsted and
are raised.</p>

<p>The card-pocket is made of tin and covered with Turkey
morocco the colour of the trimming.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig53_54" class="pginternal">Fig. 54</a> it will be noticed that the style is somewhat
different from the other; the surface of the door is trimmed
plain, the fall alone being stuffed. The fall is stuffed in
diamond form and enclosed with a lace border. This pocket
runs up under the fall to the top, and is there nailed.</p>

<p>The following remarks on lining and trimming are taken
from “Cassell’s Technical Educator:”—</p>

<p>“We may with advantage say a word to our carriage
lace-makers, who seem to have made but scant use of the
various Schools of Design for the improvement of their taste
in producing new and suitable patterns in the manufacture
of their goods. For a long period we had nothing but the
old scroll or flower pattern, which was handed down from
father to son as if by a fixed law. At length, when it was
felt that some change was required, the absence of all taste
in design was shown in the production of entirely plain
worked laces, which deprived carriage linings of their chief
element of lightness and beauty. Thanks, however, to the
taste and discernment of Messrs. Whittingham &amp; Walker,
who, perhaps, have devoted more attention to this branch of
industry than any other house in London, the trade was
relieved from the necessity of either adhering to the old
pattern or of adopting the opposite scheme. They introduced
small neat designs in laces eminently adapted to the
purpose, and in 1857 they registered a pattern, now extensively
known as the double diamond pattern, which has not
only become general in England, but is largely patronised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
throughout Europe and America. This, and kindred patterns,
exactly fulfil modern requirements, and give us the necessary
relief without extreme.</p>

<p>“But with materials well and tastefully selected the
trimmer has still his work to do. The lining of a carriage is
divided into many different parts, all of which have to be
designed. Canvas or paper patterns have to be cut to these,
and properly fitted before the material is touched with which
the carriage is to be lined. Wherever superiority of workmanship
is to be shown in this department, the French
method of trimming is adopted as being more elegant than
the English. We shall therefore confine our observations to
this method.</p>

<p>“In adopting the French method silk is mostly used in
the place of morocco, and its peculiarities consist in the
manner of quilting. The different squabs are made up in
horizontal pipes or flutes, which are tufted in different ways.
To proceed, cut a pattern in strong paper the size and shape
of the space to be trimmed, and draw on it with a pencil
the pipes, also mark the position of the tufts. On large
pieces only mark one-half, the other half being the same.
The pipes of the back are usually 12 inches high and from
3 to 5 inches wide.</p>

<p>“The position of the tufts is considerably varied. Next
stretch a piece of strong muslin in the stretching frame, lay
the paper pattern on it, and mark the position of the tufts
with an awl. Mark the lines of the pipes on the muslin
with red chalk or pencil. In the same manner the pattern
must be transferred upon the inside of the material used for
covering, making of course due allowance for the depth of
the pipes; about 3 inches is a fair average for fulness at the
top, 1 inch for the height of the pipes, and 1½ inches for the
width. For the last pipe an extra allowance is made in a
narrow strip sewed on to it.</p>

<p>“Next lay a quantity of hair on the frame and form it the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
swell desired. Keep the hair in position with a few long
stitches, and lay the silk over it. Commence tufting in the
middle of the lower row of pipes, and continue equally to
both sides. Silk cords stretched into the channels between
the pipes were at one time considered elegant, but their
main merit was that they aided materially in preserving the
original shape of the pipes. Backs are usually made couch-shaped,
with a roll all round on the top, which at the same
time form the elbow-pieces on the sides. In elegant carriages
this roll is often elaborately executed in a helical or screw-like
shape, and continued from the door-pillar down to the
seat-frame, being made by winding silk cords around the
roll. These silk cords appear as a single thread, but in
reality there are three different cords which are wound at
even distances. A style of trimming much used of late both
in France and Germany for low backs, is a row of pipes at
the lower end, which are pinched to points at the top, and
above these are three rows of regular squares. Squares are
preferred to diamonds as they are softer.</p>

<p>“Usually the back is laid on spiral springs, which are
fastened as follows:—The back of the body is covered with
coarse muslin, after being slightly stuffed, and on this muslin
four rows of seven small springs each are set. For the lowest
row, springs a little stronger may be used than for the other
rows. The highest row is set about 1½ inches below the
edge of the back-board, and the lowest row at 6 inches
above the seat-frame. The springs having been sewn on
with a bent needle, are tied first from right to left and then
from top to bottom. A thin cord will answer for this
purpose.</p>

<p>“The cord is first cut in lengths, and when the tying
begins about 6 inches are allowed at the ends. The cord is
wound about the third ring of the first and last spring in
each row, and afterwards the first ring is brought into the
right position with the piece of cord allowed over. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
will make the spring stand upright, and it can be raised or
lowered on one side. The springs being thus all placed in
position, they are finally tied crossways.</p>

<p>“The squab, in this instance, is worked in coarse muslin
or canvas, stiffened with a little thin paste. It is set in the
frame and marked as we have described above. When the
cushions press against the back and side pieces, frequently
no stuffing is made, but simply a piece of fine linen is sewed
reverse to the main piece, and this is called the ‘false finish.’
In fine work the stuffing extends clear to the seat-frame.</p>

<p>“Of course each of these variations requires a different
calculation for the muslin at the back as well as for the
cover. For the latter an allowance of 1½ inches is made for
the pipes from the lower to the upper end, and also for the
points an addition of ¾ inch. For each square in the height
1½ inch has to be calculated. The folds of squares when
laid over springs being diagonal, easily draw apart when
stretched out, while the folds of diamonds running up and
down may be drawn tighter to a certain degree of stretching.</p>

<p>“For the upper row of squares we have to allow for the
backs at least double what we have to allow for the other
rows—namely, 3 inches. For the width of every pipe an
addition of 1½ inches is calculated.</p>

<p>“Both cover and muslin being thus marked, we commence
to draw in the tufts. Every point marked on the cover has
to lie exactly on the corresponding one of the muslin. The
lowest tufts are first drawn in; then turn the frame and
commence on one side at top, every point of the pipes being
singly stuffed and the folds adjusted. This being done, every
fold of the squares can be tufted right through, stuffed, and
folded. Squares are easier to be worked than diamonds, but
pointed pipes give more trouble than the ordinary straight
ones.</p>

</figure>

<p>“The elbow-pieces of this finish consist of two rolls made
of muslin; they are thinner towards the front of the seats.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
After being stuffed, a piece of muslin 8 inches wide is sewed
on all the length to the bottom of the roll, which serves,
after the roll is tacked to the door-pillar and back, to give it
the required sweep in stretching and tacking it to the sides
of the body. Then mark on the roll the width of the pipes,
and cut the cover for it, allowing 1 inch of width; and as to
the height, the cover must go all round, the roll having to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
be sewed back and front to the linen with which the roll is
tacked to the body.</p>

<p>“After we have put in all the lining, we have to adjust the
silk curtains, the blinds and glasses to doors and front part,
to cover the iron dash-frame with the best patent leather,
trim the coach-box seat, put on all the mouldings and bearings
to the body, arrange the position of the lamps and fix them,
and generally attend to all those little finishing points which
give the appearance of neatness and finish to the whole.”</p>

<span class="fs80">GENERAL REMARKS ON THE COACH-BUILDING TRADE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is pleasing to be able to refer to the increased skill and
ingenuity of the coach workmen, especially among the rising
generation of operatives. This fact was elicited by the recent
exhibition of coaches, &amp;c. Not only were there shown several
excellent working drawings of carriages—drawn to scale and
difficult of execution, and showing that there are forthcoming
more highly educated and more competent men well acquainted
with the details of their crafts, and of the proper and scientific
manner of setting out their work, now that frequent change
of construction renders this knowledge so desirable—but
there were also shown many clever models of proposed
improvements, the work of the ordinary carriage artisans,
showing that their originators were men of thought and
energy. And no doubt if more prizes were offered, and these
exhibitions more frequent, greater competition would be
aroused, which would be the means of bringing out a great
deal of talent which at present lies dormant for want of some
inducement to call it forth.</p>

<p>The art of the coachmaker being an intricate one, inasmuch
as he has to combine in one harmonious whole a number of
most varied products—wood, iron, steel, brass, paint, silver,
cloth, leather, silk, ivory, hair, carpet, glass, &amp;c., each worked
by a separate trade, but generally in one manufactory, and
each of which may be spoilt or injured by careless or improper
treatment in any process—it behoves all engaged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the production of carriages to work in harmony, that their
united labours may approach perfection. It would add much
to this desirable end if in each manufactory, large or small,
were issued a series of printed “general directions” for
conducting the work; not rigid rules that would, if strictly
enforced, reduce men to mere machines instead of free and
intelligent operatives, but such as would so guide each worker
in the execution of his work as not only to give satisfaction
to his employer by its excellent and honest execution, but
bring equal credit and satisfaction to himself. This state of
feeling would be a very desirable one to bring about; it would
be the means of bringing about mutual respect between employer
and employed, and lead the way to a more cordial
appreciation of each other’s wants and difficulties; at the
same time it would lessen the incessant watchfulness and
anxiety necessary to insure the work being executed in such
a manner that it may be depended upon for accuracy and
excellence when completed.</p>

<p>It is not so generally known as it should be, that in
France, Belgium, Germany, and some other European States,
the training of workmen and apprentices receives a great
deal of attention, the Governments in these countries considering
money and trouble bestowed on such objects to be
of national importance. Technical schools in these countries
furnish instruction in drawing, modelling, the harmonious
arrangement of colours, the application of chemistry to
manufactures, metallurgy, and the proper working of metals,
the principles and applications of mathematics and mechanics
to manufactures, together with much that is strictly technical.
In some parts of Germany, before an employer of labour can
commence business on his own account, he must prove to
competent persons, by the execution of some trial work, that
he understands what he undertakes; and, moreover, that he
has travelled for three years in foreign countries, working at
his trade, to acquire a knowledge of its processes in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
countries besides his own. There is doubtless much
pedantry in many of the regulations that interfere with the
free exercise of trade, but culling the best points of the
system there is much good that results. The training of
apprentices in most trades in England is very unsatisfactory,
and were public attention directed to the matter, after discussing
the subject in its different bearings, there might be
some good general recommendations circulated relating to
the subject.</p>

<p>The carriages of America are so different from our own
and from those of Europe, that they require special attention.
It is quite possible that in the future their style may greatly
influence carriages in all parts. The first noticeable trait in
them is lightness, and English coach-builders generally agree
that they carry this lightness too far, more especially in their
larger carriages. We are supported in this view by the fact,
that for some years, these—such as landaus, broughams, and
coaches—have been materially modified by European types.
The Americans have adopted some of the shapes of Europe,
and the European mode of constructing the under-carriages,
retaining their own method of making the pole and splinters,
as giving greater freedom to the horses.</p>

<p>This principle of allowing the horses greater freedom for
action is well worthy of the attention of coach-builders. The
manner in which our horses are confined by tight, heavy
strapping and traces, by tight pole chains, by bearing reins,
and the indiscriminate use of blinkers to the bridles, has
been much overdone in England. If a horse with a heavy
load and driven fast over slippery roads should stumble, it is
most difficult for him to recover himself. He generally falls,
and is pushed along by the impetus of the carriage, and is
more or less injured in his limbs or nerves by the accident,
while it is a matter of great difficulty, if not impossibility, for
him to rise again till the harness be unstrapped and the
carriage is removed from above him. Our horses are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
harnessed too closely to their work in two-wheeled carriages.
We have thought only of the ease of turning and moving the
vehicle in crowded or narrow ways, without observing the
advantage of long shafts over short shafts. If the shafts are
considered as levers, by which the horse supports and moves
the weight behind him in a two-wheeled cart, it will at once
be obvious that although (whilst those levers are parallel
with the road) it does not so much signify whether they are
long or short, yet the moment they cease to be parallel
with the road, when they point upwards, or more particularly
when they point downwards, the difference between
long and short levers is severely felt by the horse. We can
all of us lift a weight or support a weight more easily with a
long lever than with a short one, and it is the same with a
horse.</p>

<p>Those who have travelled abroad must have noticed the
great weights placed upon two-wheeled carts in France and
Belgium, and the greater comparative distance the horse is
placed from the wheels, and yet he carries his load easily
enough, because he does not feel its weight upon his back.
Many English drivers seem to have observed this, and try
and ease the horse and lessen his chance of stumbling by
tipping the shafts up in front; but in this way the horse is
made to feel a pressure on the under part of his body, which
certainly will not improve his health. It is very probable
that in future years public opinion will be in favour of longer
shafts and poles. This will also tend to preserve good
carriages from the damages they at present suffer from the
heat of the horses and the quantity of mud which is thrown
by their heels upon the front of the vehicle. The reins will
of course have to be longer, but this cannot be of much consequence;
the driver of a brougham is farther from the horse
than the driver of a mail phaeton, but it is not by any means
true that the brougham is any more difficult to drive than
the phaeton on that account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>There is another fashion prevalent in this country which
is certainly a fallacy, viz. the supposed necessity for the
driver to sit nearly upright, which necessitates a deep boot
and a clumsy, thick coachman’s cushion. In America,
Russia, and parts of Germany, the driver sits low, but places
his foot against a bar in front of the footboard; this in their
carriages is longer than in ours. Four horses can be driven
very well and easily in a low landau, and very powerful-pulling
and fast-trotting horses held in with apparent ease.
Our coachmen are often in danger of being pulled over by
their horses, and certainly when an accident happens in a
collision they are easily thrown from the boxes. They do
not have the purchase and security that the Russian drivers
seem to possess.</p>

<p>One of the greatest novelties introduced by the Americans
into the United States is the “buggy,” a name first given in
England a hundred years ago to a light two-wheeled cart,
carrying one person only, and which we now call a “sulky.”</p>

<p>The Americans have lavished all their ingenuity upon
these buggies, and they have arrived at a marvellous perfection
of lightness. They are hung upon two elliptical springs.
The axles and carriage timber have been reduced to mere
thin sticks. The four wheels are made so slender as to
resemble a spider’s web. Instead of the circumference of
the wheel being composed of a number of felloes, they
consist of only two of oak or hickory wood, bent to the
shape by steam. The ironwork is very slender and yet
composed of many pieces, and in order to reduce the cost
these pieces are mostly cast, not forged, of a sort of iron
less brittle than our cast iron. The bodies are of light work
like what we call cabinet work. The weight of the whole
vehicle is so small that one man can easily lift it upon its
wheels again if it should be accidentally upset, and two
persons of ordinary strength can raise it easily from the
ground. The four wheels are of nearly the same height,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and the body is suspended centrally between them. There
are no futchells; the pole or shafts are attached to the front
axletree bed, and the front of the pole is carried by the
horses in just the same way that they carry the shafts. The
splinter-bar and whipple-trees are attracted to the pole on
swivels. Some are made with hoods and some without.
The hoods are made so that the leather of the sides can be
taken off and rolled up, and the back leather rolled, removed,
or fixed at the bottom, a few inches away from the back, the
roof remaining as a sun-shade. The leather-work is very
thin and of beautifully supple enamelled leather.</p>

<p>The perfection to which this vehicle has been carried is
certainly wonderful; and every part that is weak or likely
to give way is carefully strengthened. If well made they
last a long time without repair. The whole is so slender
that it “gives” and recovers at any obstacle. The defect
in these carriages in English eyes consists of the difficulty of
getting in or out, by reason of the height of the front wheel
and its proximity to the hind wheel. It is often necessary
to partly lock round the wheel to allow of easy entrance.
There is also a tremulous motion on a hard road that is not
always agreeable. It is not surprising, however, that with
the great advantages of extreme lightness, ease, and durability,
and with lofty wheels, these vehicles travel with
facility over very rough roads, as there is a great demand for
them in our colonies. It must be remembered that the price
is small, much less than the price of our gigs and four-wheeled
dog-carts. This cheapness is attained by making large numbers
to the same pattern, by the use of cast iron clips,
couplings, and stays, and by using machinery in sawing,
shaping, grooving, and mortising the timbers, and by the
educated dexterity of the American workman, always ready
to adopt any improvement. An educated man will make a
nimble workman, just as an educated man learns his drill
from the military instructor more quickly than a clown; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
an educated man finds out the value of machinery and desires
to use and improve it. Instead of fearing its rivalry he welcomes
it; he remembers that all tools, even the saw and the
hammer, are machines, and that the hand that guides these
tools is but a perfect machine obeying the guidance of the
brain more quickly and in a more varied manner than any
man-made machine. The American workman, therefore,
uses machines more and more.</p>

<p>In England machinery for wood shaping is used at Derby,
Newcastle, Nottingham, Worcester, and other towns, and in
Paris some very good machinery is at work in coach factories.
In London it is chiefly confined to patent wheel factories, a
few steam-driven saws, patent mills worked by hand, and
drilling and punching machines. But until the use of machinery
is more generally adopted in London, it is probable
that the trade of building carriages for export will drift more
and more to the provinces and the continent. The saving
effected by machinery in cab and omnibus building would be
great, because the patterns vary so little, and all the other
parts of a carriage would correspond with another, and
counter-change when repairs were needed.</p>

<p>The coach-builders of the future will look to steam and
hand machinery as their great assistance in cheapening the
cost of first-rate carriages, in multiplying them for the probable
increased demand, and also to build carriages more
speedily. It now takes from two to three months to build a
brougham, of which at least five weeks are consumed simply
in the wood and ironwork, a period which by the use of
machinery might easily be shortened.</p>

<p>There has been much controversy about difference in the
length of the front and hind axletree. It has been usual to
make no greater difference than will allow the higher wheel
to follow in the same track as the lower wheel. In France,
however, it has been the practice since the year 1846 to
make the front axletree of broughams 6 inches shorter than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the hind ones. The object has been to allow the front wheel
to be placed nearer to the body. As the front wheel of a
brougham must turn entirely in front of the body, the additional
gain of 3 inches was very desirable. Some English
coach-builders have followed the example of the French.
There is a decided gain. The eye is pleased with the proportions,
the horse is eased, and upon hard roads the difference
of track is of no consequence. On the other hand, in
the country roads, the well-worn ruts make the running of
the carriage uneasy, whilst in town the driver often forgets
that the curbstones will strike his hind wheels sooner than his
front ones, and also more mud is thrown upon the panels.
Under these circumstances it is very probable that the French
plan will not find universal favour.</p>

<p>If carriages had always to move along perfectly smooth
roads such as a tramway of wood, stone, or iron, the use of
wheels in overcoming friction would be their sole utility, and
their height would be of small consequence. But as carriages
are drawn along roads with loose stones and uneven surfaces,
wheels are further useful in mounting these obstacles, and it
is plain that a high wheel does this more easily than a low
wheel. To demonstrate this, let us suppose a shallow ditch
or gulley of a foot wide and 2 inches deep, a wheel 2 feet
high would sink into this and touch the bottom, but a wheel
3 feet high would only sink an inch, and a wheel 4 feet
6 inches high would only sink half an inch (the wheels are
supposed to cross the above-mentioned gulley at right angles),
on account of their greater diameters. Consequently, while
the large wheel would have to be lifted by a force sufficient
to raise it half an inch, a force will have to be applied to the
smaller wheel to raise it 2 inches, and under more disadvantageous
circumstances, because the spokes are in this
case the levers, and we know that the longer the lever the
more easily is the load raised.</p>

<p>That the leverage power of a high wheel is very great is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
shown by the advantages gained by a large wheel in locomotives
and bicycles.</p>

<p>There is an idea deeply rooted among coach-builders and
coach-buyers too, that the draught of a vehicle is diminished
by placing the front part of the carriage as far back as
possible. Intelligent men who have given the subject great
attention, and tested the actual working of this idea, say that
it is a fallacy; but other intelligent men, who also say they
have tested its working, say that it would effect a great
saving in the draught if it were successfully accomplished.
The general idea amongst practical men is, that it would not
be an advantage. We have already seen that the draught
of a vehicle with large wheels is less than that of a vehicle
with small wheels. If, therefore, a load has to be placed on a
four-wheeled vehicle, it should be so placed in relation to the
front and hind wheels that the greater part of the weight
should rest on the higher wheels. To obtain this result, it
is sufficient to bring the hind-carriage part as far under the
body as it will work with comfort and safety, in order that
as little weight as possible rests on the fore-carriage part.
English coachmakers have been working at this for thirty
years, but for the most part blindly; they have copied well known
builders in construction as well as shape; they hear
that these well known firms’ carriages run and follow very
lightly, and if they could copy accurately they would obtain
the same reputation.</p>

<p>But while there is some doubt as to throwing the front
wheels backward for the purpose of lessening the draught,
Mr. Offord of Wells Street, Oxford Street, has been exercising
his ingenuity for the purpose of throwing the back wheels
further forward, and has produced a brougham that offers
peculiar advantages in this respect (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig56" class="pginternal">Fig. 56</a>). The hind
wheel appears to be placed right across the door, but the
facilities for ingress and egress are quite equal to those given
in the ordinary brougham. This novel contrivance presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
nothing singular in appearance, while a very little reflection
will satisfy the practical thinker that the advantage sought
after, of lessening the draught of the carriage, must be
obtained far more completely with this arrangement than by
throwing the front wheel backward.</p>

<p>The rattling so constantly complained of in carriages can
in a great degree be obviated by placing pieces of india-rubber
so that the doors shall press upon them when closed; it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
good thing also to have india-rubber at the bottom of the
doors for the windows to drop upon when let down.</p>

<p>The difficulty of protecting carriages from the dirt has
recently been met by placing what is called a “mud scraper”
just at the back of the hind wheels. It is formed of a piece
of india-rubber about 3 inches square and a ¼ inch thick,
held in position by a short iron rod attached to the end of the
hind spring.</p>

<p>The elaborate dress carriages, hung with braces upon a C
and under-spring perch carriage, require so much skill and
practice in their manufacture that it is impossible to give
ample directions for their construction in a work like this.
Some years ago it was thought that no carriage could be made
comfortable unless it was hung upon the old-fashioned perch
carriage with braces; but it was found that by the introduction
of india-rubber, especially in the ends of each spring,
that what are termed elliptic spring carriages (which are of
course much lighter in draught and less in cost) can be made
extremely pleasant in motion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72016/pg72016-images.html#fig57" class="pginternal">Fig. 57</a> shows an iron-framed or “skeleton boot” for a
landau. It is extremely light and strong.</p>

<p>It is desirable to direct attention to the proper horsing of
carriages, that the owners of carriages and horses may so
adapt their plans as to get the most satisfactory result from
their arrangements. Not unfrequently a carriage is ordered
for one horse only; when it is partly made, or perhaps finished,
fittings are ordered for two horses; and it sometimes happens
that the two horses put to the light one-horse carriage are
coach-horses, between sixteen and seventeen hands in height.
Such horses, though well adapted to a family carriage, are
quite out of their place attached to a light one. Although
they can draw it at a good pace, and over almost any obstacle
in the road, and do their journey without fatigue, the carriage
suffers sooner or later. The lounging of such horses against
a light pole, the strain thrown on the pole in case of a horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
tripping, the certain breakage that must occur in case of a
fall, and the risk of overturning the carriage, should all be
considered before putting a very light carriage behind very
large horses. It also sometimes happens that miniature
broughams and other very small carriages, built as light and
as slight as safety will allow, are afterwards used with a pair
of horses. In such cases, if accidents do not occur through
the great strain of a long pole acting as a lever on very light
mechanism, the parts become strained, do not work as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
were intended to do, and necessitate constant repair from not
being adapted to the work put upon them. Carriage owners
should, in their own interest, have their carriages and horses
suited to what they ought and can undergo, bearing in mind
that there are advantages and disadvantages both with heavy
and light carriages. The former are easier and more comfortable
to ride in; they are safer for horses, drivers, and riders;
and the necessary repairs are less frequently required. The
lighter carriages follow the horses more easily, and can
therefore do a longer day’s journey; and, although the necessary
repairs may come more frequently, the saving of the
horses may be an advantage that many persons will consider
of the utmost importance. Such light carriages should,
however, be made of the choicest materials and workmanship,
that they may do the work required of them.</p>

<p>A feature in the financial department of coach-making
must not be overlooked, as it has much influence on an
important trade. In former times a large proportion of the
carriages were built to order for the owners; the reverse is
now the case; most persons select a finished carriage which
pleases their taste, or an advanced one, and get it completed
their favourite colour. This, of course, necessitates the employment
of a larger capital to meet the altered state of
trade, which now requires so large a stock of carriages to be
kept ready for use.</p>

<p>The excessive competition of recent years has so reduced
the profit on each carriage, that in order to carry on his
business without loss, the builder has to require a prompt
payment from his customer instead of giving a long credit.</p>

<p>The modern system enables the coach-builder to make his
purchases for ready money, and so buy not only better in
quality but at a less cost than for extended credit, in order
that he might in his turn give long credit to his customers,
so that he is now obliged to depend on small profits and
quick returns by turning over his capital more rapidly. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
is not now, as much as in former times, the agent of the
persons who supply the materials that he and his workmen
convert into a carriage, but rather the designer, capitalist,
and director of those who seek his service or custom, whether
to supply labour or materials.</p>

<p>From the Government returns we find that carriages of
all sorts have increased from 60,000, in 1814, to 432,600 in
1874—a benefit to the general population, it is clear, as well
as to the workmen. In 1874, 125,000 carriages paid the
Government duty.</p>

<p>The valuable library and fine series of photographs of state
and other carriages of the Coach and Coach Harness Makers’
Company are open to coach artisans every Saturday afternoon.
Tickets of admission may be obtained at the principal
coach-builders in London.</p>

<p>In Calcutta there are several coach-builders of good
reputation, and who employ large numbers of native workmen.
Messrs. Dyke employ 600 hands; Messrs. Stewart
and Co., 400; and Messrs. Eastman, 300. The men are
chiefly Hindoos, and are clever and industrious, but have a
singular habit of sitting down to their work. Owing to the
prejudices of the people in regard to the use of animal fat,
the labourers who have to use grease are chiefly Mahommedans.
The wages in the trade vary from sixpence to two
shillings per day.</p>

<p>“In Hindostan” (says Mr. Thrupp) “there are a large number
of vehicles of native build. It has been frequently remarked
that there is little change in Eastern fashions, that tools and
workmen are precisely as they were a thousand years ago,
and the work they produce is precisely the same. In examining,
therefore, what is now done by Indian coach-builders,
we are probably noticing carriages of a similar, if not identical,
sort with those in use three thousand years ago. The
commonest cart in Hindostan is called ‘hackery’ by
Europeans; it is on two wheels, with a high axletree bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and a long platform, frequently made of two bamboos which
join in front and form the pole, to which two oxen are yoked;
the whole length is united by smaller pieces of bamboo, tied
together, not nailed. In France two hundred years ago there
was a similar cart, but the main beams terminated in front
in shafts; in neither the cart of India nor of France were there
any sides or ends. The French cart is called <i lang="fr">haquet</i>, and it
is probable that the French, who were in India as well as
ourselves, may have given the term hackery to the native
cart which was so like their own. The native name, however,
is <i>gharry</i>. Other carts have sides made by stakes driven
into the side beams; the wheels are sometimes of solid wood
or even of stone. Wheels are also made by a plank with
rounded ends and two felloes fitted on to complete the circle.
Again wheels are made like ours, and also with six or eight
spokes, which are placed in pairs, each pair close to and
parallel with one another. If a carriage for the rich is
required the underworks are like those of a cart, but the pole
is carefully padded and ornamented with handsome cloths or
velvet; the sides of the body are railed or carved, and the
top is of a very ornamental character, similar to the howdah
of state that is placed on an elephant. It has a domed roof
supported upon four pillars, with curtains to the back and
sides. The passengers ride cross-legged under the dome on
pillows. The driver sits on the pole, which is broad at the
butt end, and he is screened from the heat by a cloth which
is fastened to the dome roof, and supported upon two stakes
which point outwards from the body. A variety of different
shaped native vehicles may be seen in elaborate models in the
Indian Museum at South Kensington, although they do not
show much originality of design or beauty of execution, and
are said to be really creaking and lumbering affairs. When
the Hindoos wish for a four-wheeled vehicle, the plan
appears to be to hook on one two-wheeled carriage behind
another, connecting them with a perch bolt, and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
hindermost they place the body. There is a singular addition
to their vehicles outside the wheels; a piece of wood
curved to the shape of the wheels is placed above it,
frequently supported by two straight uprights from the end
of the axletree outside the wheel. This acts as a wing or
guard to keep any one from falling out of the vehicle, and also
the dress of the passengers from becoming entangled in the
wheel. In addition, a long bar of wood, rather longer than
the diameter of the wheel, curved to the shape, called
‘Cupid’s bow,’ is fastened to the axletree, the linch-pin
being outside of it, and the ends of the bar tied to the ends of
the wing by cords. I imagine it to be placed in order to be a
safeguard for the people in crowded streets, who might be
pushed by the throng against the wheel. It will be seen in
many of the models, and also in ancient drawings of Indian
and Persian vehicles. Many of the carts which are designed
to carry heavy loads have a curved rest from 20 to 30 inches
long attached to the lower side of the front end of the pole;
this serves not only as a prop while the vehicle is being
loaded, but should the oxen trip and fall it supports the
cart and prevents the load, yoke, and harness from weighing
down the poor animals, as they struggle to recover themselves.
In England we have very few of these humane contrivances; we
have, however, short rests to prop up a hansom cab when not
at work. In India there are several huge unwieldy structures
on wheels called ‘idol cars;’ the name of the car of
Juggernaut must be familiar to many. The wheels of some
of these are of enormous blocks of stone, shaped and drilled
for the work. In the Indian Museum is a photograph of an
idol car from South India, in the district of Chamoondee and
the province of Mysore, which deserves examination. The
car appears well proportioned, and the ornamental carvings
are beautiful in design and would bear comparison with most
European work.</p>

<p>“The <i>hecca</i>, or <i>heka</i>, is a one-horse native car, resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
an Irish car. It consists of a tray for the body fixed above
the wheels on the shafts, and has a canopy roof; the driver
sits on the front edge of the tray, and the passenger cross-legged
behind him. The <i>shampony</i> is the usual vehicle for
women, which resembles the former, but it is larger; the
wheels are outside the body, and it is drawn by two bullocks;
the canopy roof is furnished with curtains that are drawn all
round, and the driver sits on the pole in front of the body.
All these native vehicles have wooden axles, which until
recently, I am told, were used without grease, from the
prejudices of the people forbidding them to use animal fat.
Some used olive oil or soap, but in most large towns there
are now regulations obliging the natives to use some substance
to avoid the noise and creaking of the dry axles. The commonest
carriages in Central India are called ‘<i>tongas</i>,’ but the
universal native word for a vehicle is ‘<i>gharry</i>.’”</p>

<p>In 1860 a carriage was made for one of the ladies of the
Sultan of Turkey’s harem. It was built, I believe, from a
design by the late Owen Jones—a great authority upon
Oriental art—and cost £15,000 of English money—a very
expensive present for the Commander of the Faithful to
make to one out of many wives.</p>

<p>The following is given in an American trade periodical,
under the heading of “Are they Competent Judges?”—</p>

<p>“Carriage-makers who seldom if ever take the lines into
their hands and ride out in carriages of their own manufacture,
are they competent judges of the merits or the demerits
of the vehicles which they with confidence recommend to
others? We think not. It is one thing to oversee and pay
well for the building of a fine buggy or any other kind of
vehicle, and quite another to experience the sensations produced
by putting them into actual wear. A buggy may be
handsome in general appearance and composed of the best
material, yet defective in ease of motion and comfort to the
occupants. The set of the axle may cause the vehicle to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
heavy, and communicate to the rider an unpleasant jarring
motion, and at the same time add unnecessary labour to the
horse. The springs may be too stiff for their length, and fail
to vibrate sufficiently under the greatest weight they may be
called upon to sustain. The seat may be too low, the back
placed in such a position or so trimmed as to be a continual
source of uneasiness, and the foot-room be cramped. These
and other defects may exist while the carriage-maker who
seldom rides out remains in total ignorance of them, in so
far as his own personal experience extends. Now an individual
having purchased a buggy of such a one, might drive
up to his door and inform him that this or that defect
existed and needed to be remedied, and fail to convince the
maker that such was the case. He would probably plead
the skill of his workman, the care with which every buggy
was carried forward to completion, and thus fortify himself
in his own opinions, through gross ignorance of what constituted
comfort while seated in a vehicle carried along over
roads of different degrees of smoothness.</p>

<p>“The tendency of such a course is toward a standstill
point in the way of needed improvement, and must certainly
work adversely to the carriage-makers’ interests. So
far as our observation extends, we are well satisfied that
the builder who adopts an opposite course is by far the most
successful. Becoming sensible of defects by personal experience,
he is keenly sensitive and anxious to remove any
cause of complaint brought to his notice by others. With
such a one the customer feels that he is dealing with a
manufacturer alive to his convenience and comfort, and will
not be apt to go elsewhere to purchase, although he may
have had occasion to point out several weak points.”</p>

<p>“The truly progressive carriage-maker tests his own work
by frequently taking airing and criticisms of those who ride
a great deal and are competent to speak on such points, and
to any little defects that may be shown he gives the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
careful examination and attention. No matter who may
suggest a new idea of value, he puts it away as so much
gained. He gathers here a little and there a little, which, in
the aggregate, when applied as little things, amount to something
so important as to give to his work an indescribable
<em>something</em> which marks it as superior, and in short gives it a
distinctive character.”</p>

<p>It is too often the case that we look upon success in business
as that condition only in which a man has secured to
himself sufficient income to retire and lead a life of comparative
ease and pleasure. While we would say nothing against an
individual choosing to retire from active pursuits and enjoy
the fruits of his labour, nevertheless the example thus set
has a tendency to create in others a desire to <em>speedily</em> arrive
at such a position careless of the means used to attain the
end, and bringing into the business other elements than industry
and the other good qualities necessary for the safe
conduct of business, viz. grasping avarice, cunning deceit,
and at times heartlessness, or, in fact, any legal means by
which they can follow the American’s advice to his son:
“Get money, honestly if you can, but get money.” These
mean, sordid feelings of course react upon the employés,
and they feel them in the shape of reduced wages and
having the greatest amount of work literally ground out of
them.</p>

<p>We hear occasionally of a man who, by a bold speculation,
has “made a fortune” in a few months, but the majority of
business men are not gifted with that keen foresight and
courage which are so essential to the speculator, and must
therefore be content with small gains, accumulating slowly
year by year.</p>

<p>It is well that it is so, for the cares and disappointments
attendant on the conducting of any business keep down
pride of heart, and secure to society a majority of that class
of men who can sympathise with the unfortunate and down-trodden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and who give more liberally to the rearing of those
institutions which benefit and improve the masses.</p>

<p>Success depends in a great measure on the knowledge of
the business engaged in, the proper application of industry
to the materials required, frugality, promptness in meeting
engagements, and good moral character.</p>

<p>In no occupation are the above qualities more essential
than that of the manufacture of carriages, yet how few out
of the whole number who claim to be carriage-makers have
a good general knowledge of the business. Four distinct
branches have to be looked after—woodwork, blacksmithing,
painting, and trimming. The materials used by the respective
branches are entirely dissimilar and costly, and require
the utmost vigilance on the part of the proprietor to see that
there is no unnecessary waste.</p>

<p>We shall close this chapter with the following remarks on
“Taste” from W. Bridges Adams’s valuable book on
“English Pleasure Carriages:”—</p>

<p>“There is a notion prevalent amongst uninstructed people
that the quality called taste is a peculiar gift which an individual
is endowed with at birth, and which cannot be acquired
by any amount of application. Some portion of this belief
is founded on reason, inasmuch as the physical faculties of
some individuals at their birth are more perfect than those
of others. Some are born with weak and some with strong
eyes, and the same difference may exist in the perceptive
faculties generally, on which faculties the quality of taste
must depend. But even as weak eyes may be strengthened
by judicious treatment, and strong eyes may be weakened
by injudicious treatment, so inferior perceptive faculties
may be improved by cultivation, and those which might
have been first-rate may disappear by neglect. Even in
those nations where the germs of taste are developed in
but few individuals, where the mass of the community
cannot discover beauty for themselves, they are yet susceptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
of its influence when it is placed before them by
others.</p>

<p>“Taste may be considered as another word for truth or
proportion, both morally and physically. Much false taste
exists in the community, and always has existed, but the
total amount is continually lessening. The reason of the
false taste is the imitative nature of man, which in an uncultivated
state follows without examining. But even as it is
the nature of water to attain a state of rest after violent
oscillation, so it is the tendency of truth and proportion to
grow out of the chaos of either thought or matter.</p>

<p>“Carriages constructed for the purposes of pleasure are
works of art, in which taste may be widely developed in
form, colour, and proportion, but the former is of course
subservient to the mechanical construction. The hitherto
defective mechanism of carriages, in which ‘a large wheel is
made to follow a small one,’ has to a great extent destroyed
proportion, and given a general license to all kinds of heterogeneous
devices and barbarous ornaments, as if to overlay
defects which there were no apparent means of obviating.
Custom has reconciled the public to this discrepancy, which,
were it now to appear for the first time, would excite
universal distaste and ridicule.</p>

<p>“In an ordinary coach the side form of the body is composed
of elliptic lines, from which the supporting iron brackets
or loops are continued into reversed curves. This contrivance
keeps the centre of gravity low. The four C springs from
which the body is suspended are each, or ought to be, two-thirds
of a circle, with a tangent to it to form a base or
support. The perch beneath the body, which connects
together the framework supporting the spring, is curved into
a serpentine line corresponding to the bottom of the body
and the loops; and thus an agreeable form is preserved.
But the double framework in front and the unequal wheels
entirely discompose the whole effect, and from an art point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
of view it is extremely disproportioned, and consequently
unsightly.</p>

<p>“Now the manufacturer possessing taste steps in, and by
lightening the heavy parts by beading, carving, &amp;c., fine lines
of colour, and the arrangement of the hammercloth, redeems
the vehicle from positive ugliness, and produces a work of
art by the harmony of the various curves as a whole,
though to produce this harmony there are no well-ascertained
rules. Therefore it is that the builder who possesses taste
produces combinations pleasing to the eye, and he who is
without taste produces unsightly works, which he is necessarily
obliged to sell at a low rate of profit as mere articles
of convenience, not of refinement. And even as articles of
convenience they are imperfect, inasmuch as the harmony of
form arises from the due proportion of parts to each other,
and that very proportion produces a greater amount of convenience.
The size and weight of a carriage ought to be
proportioned to that of the horse or horses intended to draw
it, as well as the locality in which it is to be used and the
persons who are likely to use it; and the proportion of parts
having once been accurately settled, the same rule of proportion
must be observed, whether on an increasing or
diminishing scale.</p>

<p>“After settling on the preliminary of form, the next consideration
is that of colour. Taste in the latter can do much
towards amending defects in the former, or at least can
divert the attention of ordinary observers from dwelling
upon them. Certain colours produce their effect by contrast,
as green and red, purple and yellow, orange and blue, &amp;c.;
others produce their effect by harmony, as green and drab,
or brown and amber; others again by gradation, as the differing
shades of green and brown in almost endless variety.
Colours are divided into two chief classes, the warm and the
cold. Red and yellow and their varying gradations are warm
colours. Green and blue and their varying gradations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
cold colours. The intermingling of opposite colours produces
neutrals. In choosing the colour for a carriage, it should
be considered whether durability or appearance is the first
consideration. For this country the warm colours are the
most appropriate, as we hardly have enough of summer
weather to render the adoption of cold colours general, except
to such people as can afford carriages for each different
season. The richest looking colours are not those which
wear the best as a rule; but as an exception to this the
yellows, which are both rich and showy, are amongst the
most durable colours. For bright sunny days the straw, or
sulphur yellow, is very brilliant and beautiful. Dark greens
have a very rich appearance, but they do not wear well, the
slightest specks being magnified by the dark surface. The
olive greens are preferable, more especially for the summer,
as they show the dust less, and are very good wearing colours.
The shades of brown are even more numerous than those of
the greens, and equally durable, though some of the lighter
shades have a rather unpleasing effect, far too homely for
varnish. Some of the darker browns become exceedingly
rich with the admixture of a reddish tint, from the first faint
tint up to the deep beautiful chocolate colour, the intermediate
shades between which and a decided lake afford perhaps the
very richest ground colours used in carriage-painting. Blues
were formerly a great deal used to contrast with a red
carriage part and framework. Very dark blues are now
often used, but they soon become worn and faded, the least
speck of dust disfiguring them. Drabs are scarcely ever used
for body painting, though for some peculiar purposes they
might be advantageously applied.</p>

<p>“In addition to the ground colour other colours are used to
relieve it, the framework of the body being generally painted
black; and in the case of a very dark colour being used for
the ground, it becomes necessary to run a fine line of a
lighter shade in order to mark the inner edges of the framework.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
The same process is applied to the carriage parts and
under framework for the purpose of making it look lighter to
the eye. Were the perch, beds, and wheels painted of one
colour they would look exceedingly heavy and clumsy; but
the skilful management of the fine lines, or ‘picking out,’ as
it is technically called, produces a pleasing optical illusion.
The same effect is sought also in the carved work, which
would look very bare were it not heightened and brought
into relief by the judicious application of black and coloured
lines. Heraldic bearings used to be painted very large on
the panels; in fact they formed the principal ornament, as
they were painted in their proper heraldic colours. With
bright grounds, such as yellow, the effect is often very good,
but with most other colours it destroys the general harmony,
and on this account it has been the custom of late years to
paint them very small, and very often of the same colour as
the ground, only lightened up to give relief. This is of
course the other extreme.</p>

<p>“Proportion in carriages applies to both form and colour;
as regards form, it regulates the sizes of the various parts so
that the whole may harmonise, and dictates the adoption of
contrivances for lessening the apparent size of those parts
which would otherwise be unseemly. Thus, the total height
which is necessary in the body for the comfort of the passengers
is too great for the length which it is convenient to give
it; therefore the total height is reduced, and to give sufficient
leg room a false bottom is affixed by means of convex rockers,
and which, being thrown back and painted black, cease to
form a portion of the elevation; they are, like a foundation,
out of sight, and thus the proportion of the front view (the
side is called the <em>front</em> in coach-builder’s parlance) is preserved.
In painting the body of a coach or chariot, it is
customary to confine the ground colour to the lower panels
and to paint the upper ones black, all except some stripes on
the upper part of the doors. Now, inasmuch as colour in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
this case constitutes form by means of outline, and as that
outline gives an irregular figure, it is a decidedly defective
arrangement, making the upper part of the structure look
heavier than the base. But the fact is, this defect has not
been caused by intentional bad taste; it is a mere result of
imitation, of following up old practices when the motive for
them has ceased. It was formerly the custom to cover the
roofs and upper panels with greasy leather in order to make
them water-tight, the edges of the leather being fastened
down with rows of brass nails. This leather was black, and
thus the eye became gradually reconciled to an unsightly
object from a consideration of utility. After it was discovered
that undressed leather could be strained on and
painted, it was still considered necessary to paint it black, as
the surface was not smooth enough to show well with bright
colours; and now that wooden panels are used to the upper
as well as the lower part, long custom has made the black
colour of the upper part appear indispensable.</p>

<p>“As by the present mode of constructing bodies various
joints are left exposed to view, where leather unites with
wood or two varieties of wood join in the same surface, it
becomes necessary to resort to some means of covering them,
and this is usually done by beading, as previously described.
This is not altogether satisfactory as usually done, as it gives
the side lines a broken and unfinished appearance. Where
the beading is blacked it does not show much and scarcely
matters, but the polished beading should go over the whole
of the outline, as is done in some of the best carriages, or else
it should not show at all. The elegance of a carriage depends
on the perfection of the outlines, and anything which tends
to disturb those outlines should be avoided.</p>

<p>“The handles of the doors are always made conspicuous,
being of brass or plated metal. Necessity dictates this, as
the constant action of the hand in opening or shutting the
doors prohibits the use of paint on account of its rapid wear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
The side of the carriage would look better without this prominent
projection if it could be avoided, but as that is impracticable
it is generally placed at the intersection of the
central vertical and the central horizontal lines, where it
interferes less with the outlines than it would in any other
position.</p>

<p>“In the lining and trimming of a carriage, form, colour,
and proportion are all requisites. All dress carriages have
hammercloths or coloured drapery surrounding the driver’s
seat. This forms a most prominent object, and if it does
not harmonise with the rest of the vehicle the proportion
of parts will be destroyed. The general form of the
outline must be regulated by the lines of the ironwork or
framework on which it is supported. There is great room
for the display of taste in arranging that the colour of the
hammercloth and lace, &amp;c., shall harmonise or effectively
contrast with the colour of the body. Yellow carriages are
sometimes fitted with blue hammercloths and sometimes
with drab ones, and the effect is equally good in both cases
when well managed.”</p>

<p>Careful attention to the above points will enable the
practical coach-builder to produce a vehicle as near artistic
perfection as the present shapes will allow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br><br>
<span class="fs80">INVENTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">English carriage constructors are certainly not an inventive
race, if we allow that the names by which carriages are
known are indicative of their origin. Coach is derived from
the Hungarian <i lang="hu">kotsee</i>, chariot is French, chaise is French,
landau is German, cabriolet is French, and so on with many
other names.</p>

<p>But mere invention—mere original conception—does not
constitute excellence; and if foreigners may fairly lay claim
to the greatest originality, English artists have the merit,
perhaps still more important, of gradually improving the
original designs, and so contriving all the details that, in
their state of comparative excellence, the carriages can be
scarcely recognised as constructions of the same principle as
their models.</p>

<p>That English artists are not remarkable for the invention
of new carriages is no proof of their want of talent; they
have invention in abundance if there were sufficient motives
to call it forth, and as a matter of fact invention is but
poorly paid for. England possesses abundance of mind and
matter, and there is no country in which a union of the two
is just now more indispensable, and yet there is no country
which throws greater obstacles in the way of the development
of its minds. On an English patent lasting <em>fourteen</em>
years the stamp duties amount to £175, whilst on an American
patent lasting <em>seventeen</em> years the duty is only £7, or ¹⁄₂₅th of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the English stamp duty. Under such a system no one will
be surprised to find that on December 31st, 1879, there were
only 15,755 patents in force in England, as against more than
200,000 in the United States. (These figures, of course, refer
to patents of all kinds.) It has been calculated that about
10 per cent. of patentees manage to survive the seventh year
of their patents, at which time the £100 duty is payable;
that is to say, as far as their patents are concerned.</p>

<p>English artists and artisans are little more than merchants
in their trades and methods of doing business; they cannot
afford to lose time, and their principal object is to make as
large an annual return as possible, and as large a profit as
possible on that return. Continental men are more enthusiastic
lovers of their arts and sciences. They aim at improvement
from mere liking for it, and when they fail it is
mostly from want of efficient workmen to further their
designs. The demand with them is not sufficient to make
every branch of their art a manufacture. In England, on
the contrary, the manufacture of carriages is a work of many
trades, and greater skill is produced in manipulation by the
division of labour. If chance brings in a new fashion, competition
is aroused, which does not subside until some
degree of improvement or excellence be obtained.</p>

<p>The ordinary measure of talent is held to be success, <i>i.e.</i>
the acquisition of property; though it is quite clear the
qualities which insure success are not those which tend to
produce excellence or improvement in carriages more than in
any other arts. The inventor may produce, but it is for the
most part the mere merchant or tradesman who profits by
the inventions. Carriages are made to sell as plays are
written to fill theatres, and the English carriage-builder
takes a French or German carriage to improve upon because
it saves his time and trouble, just as the English play-writer
freely uses a French play to save the labour of his brains.
Improvements are rarely the voluntary productions of English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
carriage-builders; they are forced on them by the purchasers—first
individuals and then the mass—who desire
some mere novelty, others greater ease, and others a more
rapid rate of motion. Almost all the changes and improvements
in carriages may be traced in their origin to the carriage
users and not the carriage-builders. The carriage-builders
do not lead, but they have always the means of
pressing talent enough into their service whenever a sufficient
demand offers them a remunerating return. Coaches
were first invented on the Continent, but it was in England
that they were improved into public stages, capable of being
run 10 miles and upwards per hour for days and weeks
together.</p>

<p>This was not done at once, or by any one man: it was
the combined result of numberless small improvements,
forced on by the necessity of overcoming practical difficulties.
Coach-builders have not been remarkable as a
scientific body. They have been, strictly speaking, “practical
men;” and as the knowledge they have gained by
experience has not been carefully hoarded in books, carriage
construction has remained a sort of occult matter,
without any specific theory attached to it. Each one, as he
is freshly initiated, gains his knowledge as best he can—from
verbal instruction or from a new series of experiments—and
thus a considerable portion of his time must elapse ere he can
have verified his judgment. Enough of this knowledge
exists in various brains which might suffice for the construction
of a sound theory, but it would be a difficult operation
to gather it together, for many petty feelings would be
at work.</p>

<p>Many experimentalists understand the word <em>theory</em> as
synonymous with falsehood or absurdity, as the very opposite
of <em>practice</em>. It is clear that practice must be the ultimate
verification of theory; but every true practice must
have a true theory belonging to it. The <em>theory</em> of a subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
is the <em>science</em> or philosophy of that subject; practice is the
positive knowledge or proof of the soundness of the theory.
But as theories are more plentiful than practices, and as
many of them are not verified, there are of course many
false ones. On this ground unscientific experimentalists have
acquired the habit of regarding <em>all</em> theory as false, which is
about as reasonable as it would be to assert that because
falsehood exists in the world, all truth must therefore be
extinct. This peculiarity is not confined to carriage-building;
engineering and architecture abound with it; and law
and medicine are not wanting in it. The truth is, that
human knowledge is only got together by small portions at
a time in the school of experiment, and when that knowledge
is considerable in any one branch, a true and verified theory
may be constructed from it. And when a great number of
subjects have thus been analysed and theorised, it is comparatively
easy to construct theories by analogy on new
subjects by sound principles. Newton’s theory of the universe
was just as true when he first developed it in thought
as after he had verified it by calculation.</p>

<p>It is a common notion that a mechanical inventor must
necessarily be a man of genius; but, if the matter be analysed,
it will be found that though inventors are occasionally men
of genius it is not by any means a general rule. <i>Invention</i>,
in its ordinary sense, as the word implies, is the art of <i>finding
out</i>. By <i>genius</i> is meant a species of creative power,
like that of the poet, for example, in his highest state of
excellence. Invention is of two kinds—one resulting from
a quick habit of observation, which detects the applicability
of various forms of matter to similar objects. Of this an
example may be given in the case of Dr. Wollaston, who, in
a hurried experiment needing some lime which was not at
hand, suddenly cast his eye on his ivory paper-cutter, and
with some scrapings from its surface accomplished his object.
This quick habit of observation, when it goes to the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
of beautiful forms, is akin to fancy. The other and
higher kind of invention is that which results from bringing
a theory into practice—from first imagining a desirable
result, and then bringing it to bear by the exercise of the
judgment and constant persevering efforts steadily directed
through a long period of time. The names of Brindley and
Watt are examples of this quality. When Brindley set to
work upon canals he did not create, he merely formed the
plan of levelling the surfaces of natural streams by drawing
off the water into new channels of sufficient depth, and thus
preventing the water from being wasted. The process of
forming locks was a continued series of mechanical contrivances
with purpose aforethought. When Watt first
imagined the steam engine he did not invent the power of
steam; that was known long before, and had existed from
the time that fire and water had existed. But he formed to
himself the plan by which he hoped to realise the result of
making steam an efficient human servant through the agency
of a perfect machine. The general idea of this machine
existed in his mind a long time before he brought it into
practice; and the slow process by which this was accomplished
is evidenced by the fact that the term of his patent
right was extended by Act of Parliament, on the ground that
he had not had sufficient time to reap benefit from it. An
anecdote of Watt serves not only to prove this, but also his
high-minded philosophy, which was far beyond the miserable
vanity of ordinary inventors, who aim at astonishing their
fellows rather than instructing or benefiting them. After
success had elevated Watt to the public eminence he so
deserved, a nobleman who dined in his company expressed
himself in terms of wonder on what Mr. Watt had accomplished.
Watt coolly remarked, “The public look only on
my success, and not on the intermediate failures and uncouth
constructions which have served as steps to climb to the top
of the ladder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>The power of mechanical conception is very widely extended;
it is a modification of the same power which composes
romances. The magic horse in the fairy tale, which
turned and was guided by means of a pin in the neck, was a
mechanical conception. If the same person who conceived
that had worked it out into practice it would have been an
evidence of genius, viz. imagination discovering truth by
analogical inference. Invention, then, of the highest kind
must be composed of four qualities—imagination, to conceive
a new and complicated machine; knowledge, to gather materials;
judgment, to select and combine them; and perseverance
without wearying till the truth be obtained. Those
things which commonly go by the name of new inventions are
very often mere modifications of what has been done before.
“Improvements” is the technical term applied to them.</p>

<p>The task a man has to go through in conceiving, designing,
perfecting, and patenting a complicated mechanical
invention is by no means inviting. Even when he possesses
the hand to execute what the head has contrived, only a
portion of his difficulties are overcome. A first idea is fascinating,
and apparently easy of execution. It is thought
over again and again; all difficulties are apparently surmounted
and all obstacles removed; it is, in the imagination
of the inventor, perfect. He may, perchance, know how to
draw; but if not, he must employ some one to make his
drawings for him. In this case, to avoid piracy, he must take
out a provisional patent. For this he has to pay some considerable
sum, and for a purpose whose success is uncertain.</p>

<p>Having secured his patent, our inventor sets his draughtsman
to work and the drawings are made. Then follows the
model, and ere that is completed it is discovered that there
occur unexpected difficulties in the material construction
which did not present themselves on paper. New contrivances
must be resorted to, and the model is made and
re-made many times over. It is at last completed, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
within a very few days of the time allowed for depositing the
specifications, and fresh expenses are incurred by the necessity
of paying highly those whose business it is to work
against time. When all is ready the specification is deposited,
and the inventor, perhaps, discovers that the title he
has first taken will not cover his invention on account of its
being different from his first contemplation. The title must,
therefore, be altered, and the fees paid over again. He now
sets to work to construct a full-sized sample of his invention,
and all his patience is needed. At length the invention is in
a state for practical trial. Up to this point all seems well;
but practice soon discovers a defect, not in principle, perhaps,
but in detail. A second experiment is made without success;
and many more follow ere the invention is completed alike in
principle and execution. Then begins the task of getting it
before the public. Perhaps the inventor has been sanguine,
and has attempted to introduce it to the public in an imperfect
state, and the consequent failures have excited a prejudice
unfavourable to his object. This prejudice has to be
overcome by repeated and unceasing exertions, and at length,
perhaps when half the period of the patent right has expired,
the inventor begins to reap the fruits of his skill and industry.
Public rumour is ever fond of exaggeration, and he is
soon supposed to be realising a large fortune, though most
likely he is only beginning to pay his expenses. Competition
is then at work, and rivals who have been at no expense
or trouble imitate his invention, or make just so much alteration
in it as they think necessary to evade his patent right.
He goes to law with the pirates, and then, perhaps, makes
the discovery that his title or specification is imperfect, and
that he has been labouring for years to bring to perfection
an invention from which he can reap no more pecuniary
advantage than if he had confined himself to an ordinary
trade in which imitation alone was necessary.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that a man who possesses a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
trade as a coachmaker has little inducement to embark in
the perilous field of invention. His time is mostly taken up
with his ordinary business, and unless under very peculiar
circumstances he has little or no time to study improvements.
Those who have too little business to fill up their
time are interested in producing new things in order to
attract public attention. First ideas very often originate
with mechanics and artisans, who have not the means of
putting them into practice, unless in comparatively trifling
improvements. Established tradesmen generally consider it
their interest to discourage such things, as interfering with
their plans and giving them more trouble without extra profit.
Thus, when under-springs were first adapted to carriages, it
was prophesied that they would be the ruin of the coach-making
trade, by making carriages too durable. When the
streets were Macadamised, wheelwrights and coachmakers
alike complained that it was destruction to their trade. It
is the same in other things. The Manchester cotton-spinner,
who has a mill and machinery already erected, does
not feel very benevolently disposed towards an inventor who
contrives new machinery of a better class, by which he can
underwork him and take away his trade. It may be taken
as a general rule that new inventions are viewed with
jealousy by all established tradesmen, on the ground that
they are an individual advantage, and not in the outset
advantageous to the trade in general. Therefore, they keep
them down all in their power, and when they succeed it is
by the circumstance that they are valuable in themselves, and
that the customers of the tradesmen insist on having them.</p>

<p>Sound mechanical knowledge is less necessary to the
fashionable coachmaker than taste. Taste is the one requisite,
without which he cannot thrive, and which therefore constitutes
his real business qualification. Taste is exhibited in
form, colour, and proportion, and having this he can employ
other persons to fill up the details. The general mechanism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
of carriages does not vary, and the mechanism serves as a
skeleton framework which may be clothed according to
fancy. Therefore, to produce what is commonly called a
new carriage is a work of composition, and not invention.
It is a combination of already existing parts to form a new
arrangement. The tasteful combiner may know nothing of
his wheels or axles, or their due proportion of strength, but
he has the wheelwright to take the responsibility for him.
He may know nothing of the construction of springs, but the
spring-maker is at hand ready to calculate the requisite
strength according to an estimated weight; and if the
weight should prove more than was expected it is easy to
apply an extra plate. He gives a general drawing of the
framework, and a skilful workman knows how to apportion
the scantling, and build it strongly together. A skilful
smith makes his ornamental ironwork to a given form, and
takes all the responsibility of understanding and duly working
the metal. The employer directs the painter what
portions to put in colours and what in ground colours; what
to make conspicuous and what to hide; what to lighten by
lines and what to leave heavy. The preparation of the
colours and the laying of them on are the work of the painter
alone. The enterprising maker also directs the trimmer as
to the general effect of the lining, and arranges the harmony
of the colours; but the trimmer has to study the best mode
of performing his work. The braces and other leather work
are left to the skill of the workman, who is mostly left to
select his own materials and apportion their strength; and
the ornamental metal-work is the province of the plater, who
is responsible for its wear. It is clear, however, that in
addition to taste, it is necessary that the carriage constructor
should know how to draw, in order to effectually direct
those whom he employs, and also to facilitate operations with
the purchasers who may employ him to build for them.</p>

<p>To be a complete carriage constructor a man ought to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
familiar with all the branches before alluded to. But there
are few mechanics of such universal knowledge, and still
rarer is it that they combine such knowledge with taste.
Even it would be scarcely possible for a single individual to
carry on a large business and do everything in his own
factory. It would require a very large capital and very
large premises, and also an extensive mercantile knowledge
and skill—which last is based on qualities the direct opposite
of those which nourish the faculty of taste. Mercantile skill
depends on calculation; taste is a combination of imagination
and observation. There are three modes in which carriage-building
on a large scale may be successfully conducted:
first, by a single individual whose only business is to combine
parts, and who employs tradesmen for every separate
branch; secondly, by a single individual, who employs
responsible superintendents in every branch at high salaries;
and, thirdly, by a combination of partners, one possessing
taste, another mechanical knowledge, a third mercantile
knowledge, and so on. This last mode would assuredly
produce the most certain result, provided the partners
possessed the necessary moral qualities to assure the absence
of suspicion, jealousy, &amp;c., amongst themselves. If these
evil qualities existed they would destroy unanimity, and thus
render the business unproductive by preventing efficient
arrangements.</p>

<p>It is probable that at a future time the workmen themselves
will enter into some such combination, but it must be
after the lapse of many years, as the principle of caste must
be first eradicated amongst them, which is at present so
fruitful a source of jealousy amongst the different branches.
Ere that takes place the increasing plenty of capital will
probably induce many capitalists to invest money in carriage-building,
as they now do in house-building, giving shares
and salaries to men of undoubted skill and probity in order
to insure efficiency and perseverance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI. <br><br>
<span class="fs80">REMARKS ON KEEPING CARRIAGES.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">With very few exceptions, it is to be supposed that the
greater number of those who can afford to indulge in the
luxury of carriages are desirous of enjoying them on the
most economical terms consistent with good taste, not
merely as an economy of money, but also of time and
convenience.</p>

<p>There are three ways of obtaining the use of carriages:
1. By hiring them for a short period, as a few days or weeks.
2. By taking them on lease for a term of years. 3. By purchasing
them ready made or to order. The first two ways
are now going out of date as a general rule. They are, of
course, the most expensive. Any one requiring a conveyance
for a few days, or a week or two, had better have a
cab; and as for taking them on lease, well, about four years’
hire-money would purchase the vehicle outright. So, all
things considered, it would appear the most economical and
convenient to purchase the carriage to start with, and when
it is no longer of any use there will at least be a second-hand
carriage to dispose of.</p>

<p>As a rule, carriages are not built to order. The customer
either chooses one from the stock, or selects one very nearly
completed and has it finished to suit his own taste. This, of
course, requires a very large capital to be invested in the
business of a coach-builder, and, as competition has of late
years greatly reduced the price of vehicles without a corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
reduction in the cost of their production, the manufacturer
naturally desires that his business should be as
nearly as possible a ready-money one, otherwise he will
have to do as many small, and even makers with a fair business,
had to do on the introduction of this system, viz. shut
up shop and take to something else to earn his living by.</p>

<p>People often marvel at the great cost of carriages, but
when they have read of the numberless processes each
vehicle has to go through there will be no longer food for
surprise, but wonder that they do not cost more.</p>

<p>After a carriage is purchased a knowledge of how to preserve
it from the various atmospheric and other influences,
and how best to keep it in good order, is very necessary;
for if great care is not exercised in the housing and cleaning
of a vehicle its beauty will be utterly destroyed. In order
to attain this knowledge it is requisite to remember of what
the vehicle is composed—as wood, metal, leather, hair,
cotton, silk, linen, paint, varnish, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The ordinary atmospheric influences of our climate, sun,
frost, dust, rain, and mud, all exercise a deteriorating influence
on the vehicle. The general temperature most congenial
to the durability of the carriage is that of the workshop
in which it is constructed. In atmospheric air containing
a certain amount of moisture, wood possesses a certain
standard of bulk. If it be subjected to the influence of an
atmosphere containing a greater amount of moisture it
increases in bulk, or, as it is popularly termed, it swells;
in a drier atmosphere it shrinks and is apt to crack. To
resist these evil influences all the wood used in carriages is
well covered with paint, the surface of which will resist
moisture. If this operation is well and carefully done it is
very successful, but woe betide slop-work, though in no
trade is there so little room for a scamping workman to
flourish. The result of bad painting is that moisture sooner
or later finds its way into the wood and spoils the glossy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
appearance, and if it be placed in a very dry situation the
panels will split, just as ships’ decks would leak if not wetted
several times a day during the heat of the sun. This might
be applied in a modified degree to carriages, more especially
to the wheels.</p>

<p>If due allowance be made for expansion and contraction,
the metal-work of carriages, as springs, suffers very little
from heat or cold, but moisture is apt to work a very destructive
influence upon it, especially where the paint is worn
away by friction. There the rust seizes hold of it and gradually
insinuates itself beneath the whole covering of the
paint, which strips off in flakes. Beneath the surfaces
of the spring-plates also rust is continually working damage,
and disfiguring the appearance with dirty brown lines of
oxide of iron on the exterior. Brass and plated work also
are considerably affected by damp.</p>

<p>Leather suffers greatly from heat and damp; but, like
timber, more especially when subjected to alternations of
heat and moisture. Toughness and tenacity are the chief
qualities required for leather for carriages, and these qualities
depend chiefly on the presence of a certain quantity of
oil or fatty matter which the leather imbibes like a sponge.
On this matter the oxygen of the air acts strongly, and at
length consumes it; and if it be not renewed the leather
cracks. If the leather be exposed to wet and damp this
process is more rapid, but when the leather is frequently
oiled it is apt to look dull and occasion much trouble to the
coachman, who most likely will prefer blacking it, but
the materials of which blacking is composed tend to the
decomposition and destruction of the leather. Leather
which is painted or japanned possesses little or no tenacity,
and is never oiled. The patent grained elastic leather,
which is so very much in use for hoods and knee-flaps, is a
very beautiful substance to the eye, and is quite waterproof
so long as it is free from cracks; but dryness and heat are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
liable to cause it to crack. Also, if one portion of the surface
be kept in contact with another portion during warm
weather, it is liable to stick and strip away when pulled
apart. When it cracks and water gets in, it decays rapidly.
Generally speaking, it is preferable to use oiled leather for
heads, if ordinary care and attention be bestowed upon it;
for though its durability is not so great, there is a saving of
labour in keeping it tidy, and it has a very good appearance.</p>

<p>The cloth, silk, and lace composing the lining, &amp;c., and
used in combination with wool, hair, cotton, and linen, suffer
from the rays of the sun by losing their rich colours, and
from the damp by becoming mildewed and rotten. Cloth,
hair, and wool also suffer from another cause, viz. moths.
In open carriages this is a very serious evil. Hammercloths
are protected by a patent india-rubber cloth being put over
them; cedar shavings also exercise a destructive influence
on moths. The india-rubber cloth is as good as anything
where the smell is not objected to, but this in warm weather
is very strong and unpleasant. However, it would be a
very good thing to introduce some cedar shavings in the
stuffing of linings, and this might to some extent get rid of
the troublesome pest.</p>

<p>Simple damp does not cause much damage to paint and
varnish unless it contains saline matter, then it is very
destructive; but heat, especially the strong rays of the sun,
is very destructive. The colours change, and the lustre of
the varnish disappears, and a multitude of intersecting cracks
make their appearance; and to restore the original beauty
there is no remedy but repainting. Another mischievous
influence, acting on the paint and varnish, is the various
gaseous vapours to which they are exposed. It is customary,
for the sake of convenience, to stand carriages close to the
horses’ stables, generally in a mews, where large muck heaps
are piled up in all stages of fermentation. During this process
various gases are evolved, which act on the varnish just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
in the same manner that strong acids act on metals—by
corroding or eating it away. The most destructive of these
is the ammoniacal gas evolved from the urine.</p>

<p>It is evident that the ordinary coach-house is not the best
that could be used for the purpose. The materials of a
carriage are as delicate, and require as much care, as the
furniture of a drawing-room, and therefore they should be
as carefully preserved from stable contact as the satin couches
of the drawing-room. After the carriage has been out,
whether in the sun or rain, it should be carefully washed,
and, above all, dried, taking care to wet the leather as
little as possible during the operation. It is a common
practice to wash the carriage and then leave the water to
drip away. After drying, the leather should be carefully
rubbed with an oiled rag, to restore the oily matter consumed
by the vehicle being used. The carriage should then be
placed to stand in a dry, well ventilated apartment with a
boarded floor, leaving a clear passage for the air beneath it,
and if by any means convenient, let a current of warm air
be passed through to insure its dryness. Above all it should
be away from all stables, dung heaps, cesspools, or open
drains. A gentleman should avoid placing his carriage in
any situation where he would not wish to put his wardrobe;
and with regard to the interior lining he should treat it in
the same manner. If the carriage be laid by for a time it
should occasionally be brushed out, and have a current of
warm air passed through it. Cedar shavings should also be
placed in it. If an open carriage it will require more care
than a close one. The hammercloth (if there be one) should
be covered with a waterproof india-rubber material, and cedar
shavings interposed between the two. The blacking should
also be rubbed off the leather-work, and a composition of oil
and tallow rubbed in to preserve it. The ironwork should
be painted where any bare portions show themselves, caused
by the rubbing of some other part against them.</p>

<h4> <i>Directions for keeping Carriages clean, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p><i>Washing.</i>—When a carriage is much used in the summer
season use water freely, so as to remove dust or mud before
using the sponge or chamois skin. The varnish of a carriage
is often ruined through a want of attention to this matter,
for the sharp particles of dust, which are chiefly silica, when
by means of the leather forced over the surface of the
varnish, act like diamonds on glass and score it in all directions.
Mud should not be allowed to dry on the varnish if
it can be avoided. The English varnishes take a long time
to dry, and if mud gets on it before it is perfectly dry a
permanent stain is left, which cannot be removed except by
re-varnishing.</p>

<p>In winter time it is not a good thing to wash off the mud
when it is so cold that the water freezes during the operation.
<i>Warm water</i> should <em>never</em> be used in winter time, as it is apt
to cause the varnish to crack and peel off.</p>

<p><i>Greasing.</i>—For axles and wheel-plates the best lubricating
material is castor oil. It is not necessary to apply a great
deal at a time—little and often should be the rule; for when
there is an excess of oil it oozes out and finds its way on to
the stock, and from thence is thrown over the wheels while
the vehicle is in motion. The grease is then liable to be
taken up on to the sponge when washing, and also on to the
leather, which will cause a great deal of trouble and vexation.
The wheel-plate should be particularly looked after, and not
allowed to become dry.</p>

<p><i>The Leather.</i>—Enamelled leather should be kept soft and
pliable with sweet oil or sperm oil. It will only be necessary,
while the leather is new, to cleanse the top and curtains from
dirt and rub them with a greased rag. When the leather
shows signs of drawing up and becoming hard and lifeless,
wash it with warm water and Castile soap, and with a stiff
brush force the oil into the leather until all the pores are
filled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span></p>

<p><i>Sponges and Chamois.</i>—Two of each of these should always
be kept on hand, one of each for the body and the same for
the under-carriage. The reason for this is, that after a
carriage has been used there is a liability to get grease on
the sponge and chamois after cleaning the wheels and wheel-plate
mechanism. Another reason of some importance is that
the sponges are soon destroyed by being used for cleaning
the under-carriage, which renders them unfit for use for
large panels.</p>

<p><i>The Cover.</i>—When a vehicle has been washed and housed,
it should be covered with an enamelled cloth cover, fitted to
it so as to keep it free from dust inside and out. To preserve
the wood and save expense it should be re-painted or
varnished once a year. There is no economy in saving a
few shillings this year if such saving will necessitate an
expenditure of three times the amount next year.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
